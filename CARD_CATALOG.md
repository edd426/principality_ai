| **Supply** | 10 cards |

##### Description
Deck filtering card. Discard unwanted cards and draw replacements.

##### Effect Resolution

**Phase 1: Play Cellar**
1. Add 1 action to available actions
2. Trigger discard prompt

**Phase 2: Discard for Cellar** (requires separate move)
1. Player specifies cards to discard (via `discard_for_cellar` move)
2. Discard specified cards
3. Draw number of cards equal to number discarded

##### Effect Details
- **Two-Step Process**: Requires separate `discard_for_cellar` move after playing
- **Optional Discard**: Can discard 0 cards (draw 0)
- **Discard Validation**: All specified cards must be in hand
- **Draw Count**: Always equals discard count (cannot draw more or less)
- **Deck Exhaustion**: Standard draw rules apply

##### Move Format
```typescript
// Step 1: Play Cellar
{ type: 'play_action', card: 'Cellar' }

// Step 2: Discard and draw
{ type: 'discard_for_cellar', cards: ['Estate', 'Estate', 'Copper'] }
// Discards 3 cards, draws 3 cards
```

##### Use Cases
- Discard victory cards in early/mid game
- Cycle deck to find specific cards

- Maintain actions while filtering

##### Interactions
- **With Victory Cards**: Discard Estates/Duchies for useful cards
- **Multiple Cellar**: Can play all Cellars (action-neutral)
- **Deck Exhaustion**: Can discard more than deck contains (draws available)

##### Edge Cases

**Discard 0 Cards**:
```typescript
{ type: 'discard_for_cellar', cards: [] }  // Valid, draw 0
```

**Discard More Than Deck**:
- If discard 3 but only 2 cards in deck+discard, draw 2 (no error)

**Invalid Cards**:
- Specifying cards not in hand returns error
- Must spell card names exactly as in hand

##### Strategy Notes
- Cheapest kingdom card ($2)
- Action-neutral makes it safe to play
- Deck quality > deck quantity
- Excellent in engines with dead cards
- Can be used as "virtual draw" (discard 0, draw 0, maintain actions)

---

## Effect Resolution

### Resolution Order

When a card is played:

1. **Card Movement**: Card moves from hand to play area
2. **Resource Decrementation**: Actions/buys decremented by 1 (if applicable)
3. **Effect Application**: Card effects applied in this order:
   - Cards drawn
   - Actions added
   - Buys added
   - Coins added
   - Special effects (Cellar discard prompt)

### Example Resolution

**Playing Market with 2 cards in deck**:
```
Initial State:
- Hand: [Market, Copper, Estate]
- Deck: [Silver, Gold]
- Actions: 1
- Coins: 0

Play Market:
1. Market â†’ Play area
2. Actions: 1 â†’ 0 (cost to play)
3. Draw 1 card: Silver â†’ Hand
4. Actions: 0 â†’ 1 (Market effect)
5. Coins: 0 â†’ 1 (Market effect)
6. Buys: 1 â†’ 2 (Market effect)

Final State:
- Hand: [Copper, Estate, Silver]
- Deck: [Gold]
- Play Area: [Market]
- Actions: 1
- Coins: 1
- Buys: 2
```

---

## Edge Cases & Interactions

### Deck Exhaustion

**When drawing cards with empty deck**:

1. If deck empty, shuffle discard pile into deck
2. If both empty, draw as many cards as available (may be 0)
3. Never errors on insufficient cards

**Example**:
```
Deck: []
Discard: [Copper, Silver]
Hand: [Smithy]

Play Smithy:
1. Deck empty, shuffle discard â†’ Deck: [Copper, Silver]
2. Draw 3 cards: Draw 2 (Copper, Silver), deck exhausted
3. Final hand includes 2 cards, not 3 (no error)
```

### Multiple Card Draws

**Playing multiple draw cards**:

Each draw card triggers independently. Deck shuffles between draws if needed.

**Example**:
```
Hand: [Laboratory, Smithy]
Deck: [Village]
Discard: [Copper, Silver, Gold, Estate, Market]

Play Laboratory:
- Draw 2: Village (from deck), then shuffle discard, draw Copper
- Deck now: [Silver, Gold, Estate, Market]

Play Smithy:
- Draw 3: Silver, Gold, Estate
- Deck now: [Market]
```

### Zero Actions/Buys

**Starting cleanup with resources**:

Unused actions/buys do not carry over.

**Example**:
```
- Have 3 actions, 2 buys at end of buy phase
- End phase â†’ Cleanup
- New turn starts with 1 action, 1 buy (not 4/3)
```

### Victory Card Timing

**Victory cards provide no in-game benefit**:

- Cannot be played (not action/treasure)
- Clog hand during game
- Only score at game end

### Game End Priority

**Multiple end conditions**:

If Province empty AND 3 piles empty simultaneously:
- Both conditions check after each move
- Province check takes precedence (but results identical)

---

## Supply Quantities

### Starting Supply (1-4 players)

| Card | Quantity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Copper** | 60 | Unlimited practical |
| **Silver** | 40 | Usually sufficient |
| **Gold** | 30 | Can be exhausted |
| **Estate** | 12 | Victory pile |
| **Duchy** | 12 | Victory pile |
| **Province** | 12 | Game end trigger |
| **Village** | 10 | Kingdom |
| **Smithy** | 10 | Kingdom |
| **Laboratory** | 10 | Kingdom |
| **Market** | 10 | Kingdom |
| **Woodcutter** | 10 | Kingdom |
| **Festival** | 10 | Kingdom |
| **Council Room** | 10 | Kingdom |
| **Cellar** | 10 | Kingdom |

**Total Cards in Supply**: 258 cards

### Supply Exhaustion

**Game continues until**:
- Province pile empty, OR
- Any 3 piles empty

**Strategic Implications**:
- Buying out Copper is impractical (60 cards)
- Kingdom piles can exhaust (10 cards)
- Victory piles exactly 12 (4 players = 3 per player)
