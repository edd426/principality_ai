# Dominion Strategy Guide

## Overview

Strategic guidance for Dominion. Use with Dominion Mechanics Skill for rules questions.

## Big Money: Baseline Strategy

**Definition**: Buy treasures (Copper, Silver, Gold) and victory cards (Estate, Duchy, Province). Ignore action cards.

### Buy Priority (In Order)
- **Early Game (Turns 1-8)**: Copper → Silver
- **Mid Game (Turns 9-15)**: Silver → Gold → Province (if 8+ coins)
- **Late Game (Turns 16+)**: Province → Duchy → Estate

### Why Big Money Works
Treasures compound exponentially. Province scarcity drives VP urgency.

## Game Phases Strategy

### Early Game (Turns 1-8)
**Goal**: Build 8+ coins per turn
**Strategy**: Buy treasures only. AVOID VP cards (dilutes deck).
**Why avoid VP**: Estate/Duchy in early hand reduces coin generation by diluting draws
**Typical moves**: Copper → Copper → Silver → Silver

### Mid Game (Turns 9-15)
**Goal**: Reach 10+ coins, start Province buying
**Strategy**: Treasure + Province buying. Evaluate kingdom cards.
**Typical moves**: Gold → Silver → Province (when 8+ coins)

### Late Game (Turns 16+)
**Goal**: Accumulate VP before game ends
**Strategy**: Buy Province every turn. Duchess if needed.
**Typical moves**: Province → Province → Duchy

## Victory Point Timing

**When to START buying VP**:
- Coins > 15 consistently, OR
- 2+ piles running low, OR
- Turn 15+ approaching

**When to STOP buying treasures**:
- When buying Gold doesn't meaningfully improve coins
- Economy "plateaus" at your current deck composition

## Card Evaluation Matrix

### Treasures (Always)
- **Copper** (0 cost, +1 coin): Buy early
- **Silver** (3 cost, +2 coins): Priority upgrade
- **Gold** (6 cost, +3 coins): Second upgrade

### Victory (Late Game)
- **Estate** (2 cost, 1 VP): Only when low coins
- **Duchy** (5 cost, 3 VP): When Province unavailable
- **Province** (8 cost, 6 VP): Primary late-game buy

### Action Cards (Conditional)
- **Village** (3 cost): +1 card, +2 actions → Good if Smithy exists
- **Smithy** (4 cost): +3 cards → Good if Village exists
- **Market** (5 cost): +1 card, +1 action, +1 buy, +1 coin → Utility
- **Woodcutter** (3 cost): +1 buy, +1 coin → Extra buy useful
- **Workshop** (3 cost): Gains cards → Decent economy boost
- **Cellar** (2 cost): +1 action → Utility
- **Remodel** (4 cost): Complex sifting → Skip for simplicity
- **Militia** (4 cost): Attack card → Skip in solo play
- **Throne Room** (4 cost): Complex card → Skip for simplicity
- **Chapel** (2 cost): Sifting/trashing → Skip for simplicity

## Card Synergies

Village + Smithy: Drawing 4+ cards enables more treasures
Market: Extra buy enables 2 purchases per turn
Woodcutter: Extra buy is powerful mid-game

## Decision Templates

### Template 0: Action Phase
**Do I have action cards?**
- YES → Play those that give +card or +action
- NO → End phase

### Template 1: Buy Phase Priority
**With X coins, buy**:
- ≥8 coins: Province
- 6-7 coins: Gold (mid-game) or Duchy (late-game)
- 5 coins: Duchy (late) or Silver (early)
- 3 coins: Silver (early) or Estate (late)
- <3: Copper or skip

### Template 2: Treasure vs VP?
**Decision**:
- Early/Mid + coins < 15: Buy treasure (economy matters)
- Late + coins > 15: Buy VP (finishing matters)
- Mid + Piles emptying: Buy VP (urgency)

### Template 3: Action Card Worth Buying?
**Decision**:
- Generates coins or extra buy? Probably yes
- Draws cards? Depends on coins
- Complex/unclear benefit? Skip it

## Early Game Buildup Turns

**Turns 1-3**: Build Copper foundation (7→8)
**Turns 4-6**: Silver transition (2 Silvers, ~10 coins/turn)
**Turns 7-10**: Gold introduction (2-3 Golds, ~15 coins/turn)
**Turns 11-15**: VP introduction (Provinces when 8+ coins available)
**Turns 16+**: VP focus (Province every turn)

## Endgame Recognition and Adaptation

Game ends when Province pile empty OR any 3 piles empty.

**Signals for Endgame**:
- Turn count 20+ (likely endgame approaching)
- 2+ piles have <3 cards (endgame approaching fast)
- Province pile <5 left (endgame very near)
- Any 3 piles combined have <10 cards (danger zone)

**Strategic Adaptation When Endgame Nears**:
- Stop buying treasures entirely
- Focus 100% on VP acquisition
- Buy Province before other piles empty it
- Buy Duchy/Estate aggressively to maximize VP before game ends
- Don't get caught with treasures when game ends

**Example Endgame Pressure**:
- Province: 2 left, Duchy: 3 left, Gold: 2 left
- You have 8 coins
- If you buy Gold, Province might empty next turn (game ends)
- Better: Buy Province now to secure VP

## Common Mistakes

1. Buying VP too early (dilutes deck)
2. Not buying enough treasures (growth stalls)
3. Overcomplicating (Big Money simple wins)
4. Ignoring supply scarcity (game ends at 3 empty)
5. Buying wrong action cards (most aren't worth it)

## Detailed Phase Strategy

### Early Game: Build Economy
- Don't buy Estate, Duchy, Province
- Don't buy action cards
- Buy: Copper (if 7-9 coins), Silver (if 10+), Gold (if 6+)
- Reasoning: VP dilutes. Actions complicate. Treasures compound.

### Mid Game: Acceleration
- Maintain Silver + Gold buying
- Evaluate kingdom cards (Market, Village/Smithy)
- Start buying Province (if 8+ coins)
- Stop buying Estate (wasteful)
- Decision: Treasure > VP > Action by priority

### Late Game: Finishing
- Stop treasures (economy maxed)
- Buy Province every turn (8 coins)
- Buy Duchy if Province unavailable (5 coins)
- Finish with Estates if low coins (2 coins)
- Avoid action cards (too late)

## Strategy Levels

**Level 1: Pure Big Money**
- Only treasures + VP, no actions
- Wins through consistency
- Teaches fundamentals
- Recommended for new players

**Level 2: Kingdom Awareness**
- Buy good action cards (Market, Village/Smithy)
- Recognize card synergies
- Improves win rate
- More complex but rewarding

**Level 3: Expert Play**
- Perfect transition timing
- Sophisticated multi-card chains
- Optimal supply reading
- Requires mastery of levels 1-2

**Recommendation**: Master Level 1 first. Big Money teaches fundamentals through consistent results.

## Common Strategy Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Overthinking**
- Big Money wins through simplicity
- Complex strategies usually lose
- Consistency > Cleverness

**Mistake 2: Ignoring Supply Piles**
- Game ends at 3 empty piles
- Must watch Province pile especially
- Adjust strategy when piles deplete

**Mistake 3: Wrong Action Cards**
- Not all action cards are worth buying
- Only buy if they improve economy/buys
- Skip complex cards when in doubt

## Card Category Strategy

### Treasures
Buy treasures early and mid-game to build economic engine. Each upgrade (Copper → Silver → Gold) takes 3 turns to pay for itself, then improves every future turn.

### Victory Cards
Buy VP only when:
1. Your economy is plateaued (can't improve much)
2. Endgame is approaching (supply piles low)
3. You've accumulated sufficient coins (usually 15+)

Buying VP too early dilutes your deck, reducing coins per turn.

### Action Cards
Buy action cards only when:
1. They generate coins directly
2. They give extra buys (multiplies your purchases)
3. They synergize with other cards (Village + Smithy)

Most action cards complicate decisions. Keep strategy simple.

## Quick Lookup: When to Buy Each Card

| Card | Early | Mid | Late |
|------|-------|-----|------|
| Copper | Yes | No | No |
| Silver | Yes | Yes | Maybe |
| Gold | Yes | Yes | Maybe |
| Estate | No | No | Maybe |
| Duchy | No | Maybe | Yes |
| Province | No | Maybe | Yes |
| Village | Maybe | Maybe | No |
| Smithy | Maybe | Maybe | No |
| Market | Maybe | Maybe | No |

Decision depends on game state and your economy. Master the fundamentals first!

## Strategy Testing Checklist

**Before buying, ask yourself**:
1. What is my current coins per turn?
2. What is the current game turn?
3. How many piles are below 3 cards?
4. Is Province pile getting low?
5. Can I afford my target card?
6. Will this card improve my economy?

**Quick decisions**:
- Early game + low coins? Buy treasures
- Mid-game + medium coins? Buy treasures or Province
- Late game + high coins? Buy Province or Duchy
- Endgame signals? Buy VP only

This mental checklist helps you make consistent strategic decisions that win games.
