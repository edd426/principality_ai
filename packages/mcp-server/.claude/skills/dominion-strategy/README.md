## Who Should Use This

You should reference this skill when:
- Deciding which card to buy
- Wondering if you should buy treasures or VP cards yet
- Trying to understand whether a kingdom card is worth buying
- Evaluating economy vs VP acquisition tradeoff
- Adapting to game state changes
- Learning how to think strategically about Dominion

## Key Concepts

1. **Big Money is baseline**: Buy treasures and VP, no action cards. Simple and effective.
2. **Economy compounds**: Early investment in treasures pays off late game.
3. **VP timing matters**: Buy too early → weak economy. Buy too late → not enough VP.
4. **Supply awareness**: Track which piles are emptying. Game ends when 3 are empty.
5. **Adapt strategically**: Adjust your plan based on kingdom cards and game state.

## Quick Strategy Guide

**Early Game (Turns 1-8)**
- Buy treasures: Copper, Silver, Gold
- Focus: Build economic foundation
- Ignore: VP cards (too expensive, won't help yet)

**Mid Game (Turns 9-15)**
- Buy treasures: Silver, Gold primarily
- Consider: VP cards if you're ahead
- Track: Supply piles for scarcity

**Late Game (Turns 16+)**
- Buy: VP cards (Province/Duchy/Estate)
- Treasures: Only if economy isn't maxed out
- Goal: Accumulate VP before game ends

## Decision Trees

### "Should I buy this card?"

```
Is it a treasure (Copper/Silver/Gold)?
  → YES: Buy if coins allow (treasures = economy foundation)
  → NO: Continue...

Is it a VP card (Estate/Duchy/Province)?
  → YES: Buy if:
    - You're in late game, OR
    - Supply piles are emptying, OR
    - You can't improve economy further
  → NO: Continue...

Is it a kingdom action card?
  → YES: Buy only if:
    - It generates coins, OR
    - It draws cards that enable treasures, OR
    - It gives extra buys
  → NO: Probably skip
```

### "Treasure or VP?"

At current coins, you can buy either:
- **Buy Treasure**: Economy improves slightly, but dilutes deck with non-coins in draws
- **Buy VP**: No economy improvement, but moves toward winning condition

**Decision**:
- If coins per turn < 15: Buy treasure (economy still growing)
- If coins per turn 15-20: Buy either (approaching plateau)
- If coins per turn > 20: Buy VP (economy maxed out)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Buying VP cards too early** - Dilutes your deck, slows economy growth
2. **Ignoring kingdom cards completely** - Some are genuinely useful
3. **Overthinking decisions** - Big Money wins through consistency
4. **Not tracking supply piles** - Surprise game end when 3 piles empty
5. **Buying too many Estates** - Province better value (6 VP vs 3 for similar cost)
6. **Hoarding coins** - Spend what you earn; unspent coins waste potential

## Strategies Reference

- **STRATEGY-1**: Pure Big Money (simplest, often wins)
- **STRATEGY-2**: Early Silver focus (slightly different pacing)
- **STRATEGY-3**: Aggressive VP early (risky but high VP)
- **STRATEGY-4**: Late-game VP shift (pure economy then VP)
- **STRATEGY-5**: Village+Smithy synergy (action card examples)
- **STRATEGY-6**: Market spam (extra buys matter)
- **STRATEGY-7-16**: Additional realistic scenarios

See STRATEGIES.md for detailed walkthroughs of each.

## Philosophy

Dominion strategy has three levels:

**Level 1: Pure Big Money**
- Buy treasures and VP cards only
- Ignore kingdom cards
- Win through consistent economic growth

**Level 2: Kingdom Awareness**
- Recognize good vs bad kingdom cards
- Buy beneficial action cards occasionally
- Adapt to what's available

**Level 3: Expert Play**
- Sophisticated multi-card synergies
- Perfect timing on VP transition
- Adapt dynamically to game state

**Recommendation**: Master Level 1 first. Big Money wins frequently and teaches you fundamentals. Level 2-3 come naturally once you understand economics.

- Card evaluation: See SKILL.md "Card Evaluation Framework"

## Economic Terms

- **Coins per turn**: Total coins generated from treasures in a typical hand
- **Economy plateau**: When buying more treasures no longer meaningfully improves coins (maxed)
- **Supply scarcity**: When a pile is running low (< 3 cards left)
- **VP efficiency**: Cost vs victory points gained (Province = 8 cost for 6 VP is efficient)
- **Deck dilution**: When non-treasure cards reduce average coin generation
