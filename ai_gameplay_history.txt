Great! Now that the MCP connection is live, let me start a new game session:

⏺ principality - game_session (MCP)(command: "new")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "gameId": "game-1761170025589-by6useku4",
     … +35 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Excellent! The game has started. Let me observe the current state and make our first move:

⏺ principality - game_observe (MCP)(detail_level: "standard")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "detail_level": "standard",
     … +26 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Perfect! Here's our Turn 1 Status:

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  We're in the Action Phase with:
  - Hand: 4 Copper + 1 Estate
  - Resources: 1 Action, 1 Buy, $0 coins
  - Available Moves: Only "end phase" (we have no action cards to play)

  In Dominion, treasures are played in the Buy Phase, not Action Phase. Since we have no action cards, we should end the
  action phase and move to the Buy Phase where we can play our Coppers to generate coins.

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Let me end the action phase:

⏺ principality - game_execute (MCP)(move: "end")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "message": "Executed: end",
     … +2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Great! Now we're in the Buy Phase. Let me observe what's available:

⏺ principality - game_observe (MCP)(detail_level: "standard")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "detail_level": "standard",
     … +56 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Perfect! Now we're in the Buy Phase. I can see we have 4 Coppers to play. Let me play all of them to generate coins:

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  Playing all 4 Coppers will give us $4 total (1 coin each). This will let us buy something better than just a basic Copper.
  With $4, we can afford a Silver ($3), Village ($3), or Woodcutter ($3)—all of which improve our deck for future turns.

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Let me play all the Coppers:

⏺ principality - game_execute (MCP)(move: "play_treasure Copper")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "message": "Executed: play_treasure Copper"
     }

⏺ principality - game_execute (MCP)(move: "play_treasure Copper")

       "success": true,
       "message": "Executed: play_treasure Copper"
     }

⏺ principality - game_execute (MCP)(move: "play_treasure Copper")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "message": "Executed: play_treasure Copper"
     }

⏺ Excellent! All 4 Coppers played. Now let me check what cards are available to buy:

⏺ principality - game_observe (MCP)(detail_level: "standard")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "detail_level": "standard",
     … +56 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ I notice the coins aren't updating—still showing $0. Let me try with full detail level to see the complete game state:

⏺ principality - game_observe (MCP)(detail_level: "full")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "detail_level": "full",
     … +139 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Perfect! Now I can see the full state. Here's Turn 1 Buy Phase Summary:

  Current Status:
  - Coins: $4 (from playing 4 Coppers)
  - Buys: 1
  - Hand: 1 Estate
  - Supply Available: All cards in stock
    - Treasures: Copper, Silver, Gold
    - Victory: Estate, Duchy, Province
    - Actions: Village, Smithy, Laboratory, Market, Woodcutter, Festival, Council Room, Cellar

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  With $4, I have three strategic options:

  1. Buy Silver ($3) - Classic "big money" strategy: gradually upgrade treasures
  2. Buy Village ($3) - Start an action engine for future turns (chains actions together)
  3. Buy Woodcutter ($3) - Hybrid card: +2 coins AND +1 buy (solid economy)

  Given that we're just starting, I think Village is the strongest choice. It gives us +2 actions and +1 card, letting us
  chain multiple actions together in future turns. This creates compounding growth better than just upgrading treasures.

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Let me buy Village:

⏺ principality - game_execute (MCP)(move: "buy Village")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "message": "Executed: buy Village"
     }

⏺ Great! Village purchased. Now let me end the buy phase and move to cleanup:

⏺ principality - game_execute (MCP)(move: "end")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "message": "Executed: end",
     … +2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Now in cleanup phase. Let me check the state:

⏺ principality - game_observe (MCP)(detail_level: "standard")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "detail_level": "standard",
     … +25 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ We're in cleanup phase now. Since we have --manual-cleanup, I need to explicitly end it. Let me do that:

⏺ principality - game_execute (MCP)(move: "end")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "message": "Executed: end",
     … +2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Perfect! Now we're moving into Turn 2. Let me observe the full state:

⏺ principality - game_observe (MCP)(detail_level: "full")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "detail_level": "full",
     … +118 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Excellent! We're now in Turn 2 - Action Phase. Here's the situation:

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  Turn 2 hand: 3 Copper + 2 Estate

  Notice something important: we don't have the Village we just bought! The Village went to our discard pile after Turn 1
  cleanup. In Dominion, cards you buy go to your discard pile, then get shuffled back into your deck when you draw. Since we
  only have 5 cards in hand and draw 5 per turn, the Village will appear in Turn 3 or later.

  Our deck is cycling:
  - Draw pile: 0 cards (empty, will reshuffle)
  - Discard pile: 6 cards (Village + 4 Copper + 1 Estate from Turn 1)
  - Hand: 5 cards (current hand)

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  We have no action cards in hand yet (Village is in the discard pile), so we can only end the action phase and play
  treasures. Let me proceed:

⏺ principality - game_execute (MCP)(move: "end")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "message": "Executed: end",
     … +2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Now in Buy Phase. Let me observe and play our treasures:

⏺ principality - game_observe (MCP)(detail_level: "standard")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "detail_level": "standard",
     … +50 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Let me play all 3 Coppers:

⏺ principality - game_execute (MCP)(move: "play_treasure Copper")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "message": "Executed: play_treasure Copper"
     }

⏺ principality - game_execute (MCP)(move: "play_treasure Copper")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "message": "Executed: play_treasure Copper"
     }

⏺ principality - game_execute (MCP)(move: "play_treasure Copper")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "message": "Executed: play_treasure Copper"
     }

⏺ Good! Now let me check what we can buy with $3:

⏺ principality - game_observe (MCP)(detail_level: "full")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "detail_level": "full",
     … +138 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Turn 2 Buy Phase - Strategic Decision:

  We have $3 and can afford:
  - Silver ($3) - Upgrade our treasures
  - Village ($3) - Another action card for the engine
  - Woodcutter ($3) - +2 coins, +1 buy
  - Cellar ($2) - Action card with draw effect
  - Estate ($2) - Small VP gain

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  Turn 2 is the critical decision point. We have two competing strategies:

  1. Big Money Path: Buy Silver to gradually accumulate powerful treasures
  2. Engine Path: Buy another Village to establish action chains

  Since we already committed to Village last turn, let's continue that engine strategy. Buying another Village is strong
  because:
  - Two Villages together create powerful action chains
  - Playing Village → play another Village → play other actions
  - This scales better than just accumulating Silver

  Let me buy another Village:

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

⏺ principality - game_execute (MCP)(move: "buy Village")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "message": "Executed: buy Village"
     }

⏺ Great! Second Village purchased. Now let me end the buy phase:

⏺ principality - game_execute (MCP)(move: "end")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "message": "Executed: end",
     … +2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Now in cleanup. Let me end it to move to Turn 3:

⏺ principality - game_execute (MCP)(move: "end")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "message": "Executed: end",
     … +2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Perfect! Now we're in Turn 3 - Action Phase. This should be exciting—we should have Villages in hand now! Let me observe:

⏺ principality - game_observe (MCP)(detail_level: "full")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "detail_level": "full",
     … +118 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Interesting! Turn 3 - No Villages yet!

  Hand: 3 Copper + 2 Estate (still no Villages)

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  This is a key learning moment about deck cycling in Dominion:

  - Draw pile: 7 cards remaining
  - Discard pile: 0 cards (was just reshuffled into draw pile)
  - Hand: 5 cards (drawn from top of deck)

  The two Villages we bought (Turn 1 and Turn 2) are still sitting in the discard pile or haven't been drawn yet. With a
  10-card deck (7 Copper + 3 Estate) at the start, adding 2 Villages makes it 12 cards. Since we draw 5 per turn, it takes
  2-3 turns for new cards to cycle back to hand.

  This illustrates a classic Dominion tension: engine building requires patience. We're investing in future turns now.

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Since we have no action cards, let me end the action phase:

⏺ principality - game_execute (MCP)(move: "end")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "message": "Executed: end",
     … +2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Now in Buy Phase. Let me play treasures and see what we can buy:

⏺ principality - game_execute (MCP)(move: "play_treasure Copper")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "message": "Executed: play_treasure Copper"
     }

⏺ principality - game_execute (MCP)(move: "play_treasure Copper")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "message": "Executed: play_treasure Copper"
     }

⏺ principality - game_execute (MCP)(move: "play_treasure Copper")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "message": "Executed: play_treasure Copper"
     }

⏺ Let me check what we can buy with $3:

⏺ principality - game_observe (MCP)(detail_level: "full")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "detail_level": "full",
     … +138 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Turn 3 Buy Phase - Strategic Decision:

  We have $3 and can buy: Silver, Village, Woodcutter, Cellar, or Estate.

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  This is a turning point. We're still in the "waiting for Villages to show up" phase. Our options:

  1. Buy Silver - Shift toward Big Money strategy (treasures over actions)
  2. Buy Village - Double down on engine (3 total Villages now)
  3. Buy Woodcutter - Get economy AND an extra buy

  Since we've already invested 2 Villages and they haven't appeared yet, I think it's time to pivot strategy slightly. Let me
   buy Silver to improve our treasure base while we wait for the Villages to cycle. This way when Villages DO show up, we'll
  have better treasures to support them.

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

⏺ principality - game_execute (MCP)(move: "buy Silver")
  ⎿  {

  ⎿  {

⏺ Excellent! We're now in Turn 4 - Action Phase. Let me check if the Villages finally showed up:

⏺ principality - game_observe (MCP)(detail_level: "full")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "detail_level": "full",
     … +130 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ YES! Turn 4 - The Engine Arrives!

  Hand: 2 Villages + 3 Copper

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  This is the payoff moment! After 3 turns of waiting, both Villages have cycled back to hand. Now we can see the engine in
  action:

  Village Synergy:
  - Play Village #1: +1 Card, +2 Actions (now have 3 actions, 6 cards)
  - Play Village #2: +1 Card, +2 Actions (now have 4 actions, 7 cards)
  - Result: We chain 2 Villages together and draw more cards into a bigger hand

  This is the core of action-based strategy in Dominion—each card played can enable playing more cards, creating exponential
  growth.

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Let me play both Villages to see the full power:

⏺ principality - game_execute (MCP)(move: "play_action Village")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": false,
       "error": {
     … +4 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ principality - game_execute (MCP)(move: "play_action Village")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": false,
       "error": {
     … +4 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Ah, I need to use index numbers! Let me try again with the correct format:

⏺ principality - game_execute (MCP)(move: "play 0")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "message": "Executed: play 0"
     }

⏺ principality - game_execute (MCP)(move: "play 3")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": false,
       "error": {
     … +8 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Let me check the current state after playing the first Village:

⏺ principality - game_observe (MCP)(detail_level: "full")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "detail_level": "full",
     … +130 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ The state looks unchanged. Let me try using index 3 for the second Village:

⏺ principality - game_execute (MCP)(move: "play 3")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": false,
       "error": {
     … +8 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Interesting—it looks like after playing the first Village, the hand got reorganized and I can't target index 3 anymore. Let
   me try index 0 again (which should now be the second Village):

⏺ principality - game_execute (MCP)(move: "play 0")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": false,
       "error": {
     … +8 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Let me check the full state again to see what happened:

⏺ principality - game_observe (MCP)(detail_level: "full")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": true,
       "detail_level": "full",
     … +130 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ I see the issue—the move I sent earlier didn't actually execute (it failed silently or wasn't applied). The state shows
  both Villages still in hand. Let me try playing index 0 (first Village):

⏺ principality - game_execute (MCP)(move: "play 0")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": false,
       "error": {
     … +8 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ This is strange—it says "Valid plays: Village" but play 0 isn't legal. Let me try the card name format instead:

⏺ principality - game_execute (MCP)(move: "play Village")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": false,
       "error": {
     … +4 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ There seems to be a bug in the MCP server's move parsing. The error messages are contradictory. Let me try index 1 (the
  second card):

⏺ principality - game_execute (MCP)(move: "play 1")
  ⎿  {                                                                                                                      
       "success": false,
       "error": {
     … +8 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ I apologize—we've hit a bug in the MCP server. The error messages are contradictory:
  - It says "Valid plays: Village. Use play 0, play 1, etc."
  - But then rejects play 0 and play 1 as invalid

  This looks like there's an issue with the move validation logic in the game-execute tool. The first play 0 command we sent
  earlier seems to have failed even though it returned "success": true.

  Let me try a different approach—let me end this turn and see if we can continue to the next turn, or we could try
  restarting with a fresh game to see if this issue persists:

  Would you like me to:
  1. Try end to skip this turn and see if the game progresses normally
  2. End the current game and start fresh to debug this issue
  3. Continue trying different move formats

  What would you prefer?
