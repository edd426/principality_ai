## STRATEGY-1: Pure Big Money

**Philosophy**: Buy treasures + VP only. No action cards.

**Turn-by-turn breakdown**:
- Turns 1-3: Buy Copper twice, then Silver
- Turns 4-6: Buy Silver, Copper, Silver
- Turns 7-10: Buy Gold aggressively (6+ coins)
- Turns 11-15: Buy Gold + start Province (8+ coins)
- Turns 16+: Buy Province every turn

**Result**: Compound economic growth. Simple, effective, wins frequently.

---

## STRATEGY-2: Silver Focus

**Philosophy**: Heavy Silver buying before Gold introduction.

**Turns 1-4**: Buy Copper, Copper, Silver, Silver
- Deck has 3 Silver early → ~14 coins per turn by T4

**Turns 5-7**: Introduce Gold
- Buy Gold (6 coins)

**Turns 8+**: Province buying
- Consistent 20+ coins per turn

**Advantage**: Smoother mid-game than pure Big Money.

---

## STRATEGY-3: Aggressive VP Early

**Philosophy**: Buy Provinces as soon as possible (Turn 8-10).

**Turns 1-7**: Economy sprint (treasures only)
- T7: Should have 20+ coins available

**Turns 8-10**: Province blitz
- Buy Province every turn if available

**Result**: High VP accumulation early. Wins if supply doesn't run out.

---

## STRATEGY-4: Late Game Shift

**Philosophy**: Pure treasures Turns 1-15, then VP focus.

**Turns 1-15**: Treasure buildup only (no VP)
- By T15: 25-30 coins per turn consistently

**Turns 16+**: VP acquisition
- Buy Province every turn until game ends

**Advantage**: Maximal economic efficiency.

---

## STRATEGY-5: Village + Smithy Synergy

**Assumptions**: Kingdom includes Village (3 cost) and Smithy (4 cost).

**Turns 1-5**: Foundation (treasures)
**Turn 4**: Buy Village (first action card, 10 coins)
**Turn 5+**:
- Action phase: Play Village (+1 card, +2 actions)
- Play Smithy (+3 cards)
- Result: 4 extra cards in hand
- Buy phase: More treasures to play → more coins

**Result**: Action synergy multiplies. Better economy than pure treasures.

---

## STRATEGY-6: Market Spam

**Assumptions**: Kingdom includes Market (5 cost).

**Turns 1-5**: Build to 15 coins
**Turns 6-8**: Buy Market repeatedly
- T6: Buy Market (gets +1 buy)
- T7: 2 buys available → buy Silver + Market
- T8: 3 Markets, +3 buys possible

**Result**: Extra buys enable 2-4 purchases per turn. Accelerated acquisition.

---

## STRATEGY-7: Timing Province Transition

**Scenario**: T12, have 18 coins, Province pile at 6 left, Gold at 8 left.

**Decision**: Buy Province or Gold?

**Analysis**:
- Province now: Secure VP while available
- Gold: Improves economy slightly
- Province scarcity: Getting low

**Best choice**: Buy Province (supply urgency > economy gain).

---

## STRATEGY-8: Recognizing Economic Plateau

**Scenario**: T18, deck has 6 Gold + 7 Silver + 5 Copper.

**Coin calculation**:
- Best hand (all treasures): 2-3 Gold + 1 Silver = 8-10 coins
- Average hand: ~20 coins
- Realistic ceiling: Can't improve much more

**Recognition**: Economy has plateaued. Stop buying treasures. Buy VP.

---

## STRATEGY-9: Supply Scarcity Awareness

**Game state T15**:
```
Province: 2 left (was 8)
Gold: 4 left (was 8)
Silver: 8 left
```

**Observations**: Province critically low, Gold also running low.

**Adaptation**: Buy available VP now. Can't wait. Supply pressure.

---

## STRATEGY-10: Endgame Pressure

**Game state T20**:
```
Empty piles: 2
  - Copper: 0 left
  - Estate: 0 left
Low piles:
  - Province: 1 left
  - Duchy: 1 left
```

**Reality**: One more empty pile → game ends.

**Decision**: Buy Province NOW (last one available). High-risk timing.

---

## STRATEGY-11: Supply-Driven Decisions

**Scenario**: 3 piles have <5 left, game ending soon.

**Strategy change**: Stop building treasures. Focus on VP only.

**Reasoning**: Game will end before economy matters. Secure VP now.

---

## STRATEGY-12: Hand Composition Evolution

**Turn 5**: 8 Copper + 1 Silver + 3 Estate = ~8 coins/turn
**Turn 10**: 6 Copper + 3 Silver + 2 Gold + 1 Province = ~18 coins/turn
**Turn 15**: 4 Copper + 3 Silver + 4 Gold + 2 Province + 2 Duchy = ~22 coins/turn

**Pattern**: Deck strengthens over time. This is compound growth.

---

## STRATEGY-13: Duchy Timing

**Scenario T14**: 6 coins available.

**Options**:
1. Buy Gold (improves economy)
2. Buy Duchy (gets 3 VP)

**Early game**: Buy Gold (economy matters)
**Late game**: Buy Duchy (VP matters)
**Mid game**: Depends on piles. Scarce piles → Duchy. Normal → Gold.

---

## STRATEGY-14: Economic Ceiling Recognition

**Deck analysis**:
- 6 Gold (3 coins each) = 18 coins max
- 3 Silver (2 coins each) = 6 coins
- 6 Copper (1 coin each) = 6 coins
- Total if all treasures: 30 coins (impossible hand size)
- Realistic best hand: 2-3 Gold + 1 Silver = 8-10 coins
- Average hand: ~12-15 coins

**Conclusion**: Can't improve much. Buy VP.

---

## STRATEGY-15: Action Card Evaluation

**Scenario**: You have 10 coins. Consider buying either:
- Gold (6 coins): Improves economy
- Market (5 coins): +1 buy, +1 coin, +1 action, +1 card

**Analysis**:
- Market gives +1 buy: Can buy 2 cards instead of 1
- Market gives +1 coin: Helps Buy phase (immediate value)
- Market gives +1 action and +1 card: Enables more plays

**Decision**: Market is good (multiple benefits). Buy it.
- You have 5 coins left for another card
- Extra buy means 2 purchases this turn
- Value > single Gold

**Lesson**: Evaluate action cards by total benefit, not just cost.
