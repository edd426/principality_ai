## Big Money: Baseline Strategy

**Definition**: Buy treasures (Copper, Silver, Gold) and victory cards (Estate, Duchy, Province). Ignore action cards.

### Buy Priority (In Order)
- **Early Game (Turns 1-8)**: Copper → Silver
- **Mid Game (Turns 9-15)**: Silver → Gold → Province (if 8+ coins)
- **Late Game (Turns 16+)**: Province → Duchy → Estate

### Why Big Money Works
Treasures compound exponentially. Province scarcity drives VP urgency.

## Game Phases Strategy

### Early Game (Turns 1-8)
**Goal**: Build 8+ coins per turn
**Strategy**: Buy treasures only. AVOID VP cards (dilutes deck).
**Why avoid VP**: Estate/Duchy in early hand reduces coin generation by diluting draws
**Typical moves**: Copper → Copper → Silver → Silver

### Mid Game (Turns 9-15)
**Goal**: Reach 10+ coins, start Province buying
**Strategy**: Treasure + Province buying. Evaluate kingdom cards.
**Typical moves**: Gold → Silver → Province (when 8+ coins)

### Late Game (Turns 16+)
**Goal**: Accumulate VP before game ends
**Strategy**: Buy Province every turn. Duchess if needed.
**Typical moves**: Province → Province → Duchy

## Victory Point Timing

**When to START buying VP**:
- Coins > 15 consistently, OR
- 2+ piles running low, OR
- Turn 15+ approaching

**When to STOP buying treasures**:
- When buying Gold doesn't meaningfully improve coins
- Economy "plateaus" at your current deck composition

## Card Evaluation Matrix

### Treasures (Always Priority)
- **Copper** (0 cost, +1 coin): Buy early only if you have 7-9 coins and no better option
- **Silver** (3 cost, +2 coins): **PRIMARY EARLY BUY** - Best ROI in early game
- **Gold** (6 cost, +3 coins): Second upgrade after Silvers

### Victory (Late Game Only)
- **Estate** (2 cost, 1 VP): Only when low coins in late game
- **Duchy** (5 cost, 3 VP): When Province unavailable in late game
- **Province** (8 cost, 6 VP): Primary late-game buy

### Action Cards (Optional But Encouraged for Testing)

**Important**: Pure Big Money (ignoring actions) is a valid winning strategy. However, buying and playing action cards creates variety and tests game mechanics.

**Recommended Action Cards to Try**:
- **Village** (3 cost): +1 card, +2 actions → **BUY EARLY** (turns 2-4) when available
  - Why: Enables playing Smithy + other actions in same turn
  - Play before: Always play Village FIRST, then Smithy (Village gives actions to play Smithy)
  - Testing value: Tests action chaining and multi-action turns

- **Smithy** (4 cost): +3 cards → **EXCELLENT with Village**
  - Why: Draw 3 extra cards means more coins + treasures for that turn
  - Synergy: Village → Smithy creates powerful turns
  - Testing value: Tests card draw mechanics and multi-card interactions

- **Market** (5 cost): +1 card, +1 action, +1 buy, +1 coin → **STRONG mid-game**
  - Why: All stats useful (+buy means 2 purchases in one turn)
  - Can replace treasures: Better long-term than Silver
  - Testing value: Tests +buy mechanic

**Skip (Too Complex for MVP)**:
- **Woodcutter** (3 cost): +1 buy, +1 coin → Similar to Market but worse
- **Workshop** (3 cost): Gains cards → Conditional, complex decision
- **Cellar** (2 cost): +1 action → Weak alone
- **Remodel** (4 cost): Complex sifting → Skip for simplicity
- **Militia** (4 cost): Attack card → Skip in solo play
- **Throne Room** (4 cost): Complex card → Skip for simplicity
- **Chapel** (2 cost): Sifting/trashing → Skip for simplicity

## Card Synergies

Village + Smithy: Drawing 4+ cards enables more treasures
Market: Extra buy enables 2 purchases per turn
Woodcutter: Extra buy is powerful mid-game

## Decision Templates

### Template 0: Action Phase
**Do I have action cards?**
- YES → Play those that give +card or +action
- NO → End phase

### Template 1: Buy Phase Priority
**With X coins, buy**:
- ≥8 coins: Province
- 6-7 coins: Gold (mid-game) or Duchy (late-game)
- 5 coins: Duchy (late) or Silver (early)
- 3 coins: Silver (early) or Estate (late)
- <3: Copper or skip

### Template 2: Treasure vs VP?
**Decision**:
- Early/Mid + coins < 15: Buy treasure (economy matters)
- Late + coins > 15: Buy VP (finishing matters)
- Mid + Piles emptying: Buy VP (urgency)

### Template 3: Action Card Worth Buying?
**Decision**:
- Generates coins or extra buy? Probably yes
- Draws cards? Depends on coins
- Complex/unclear benefit? Skip it

## Early Game Buildup Turns

**Turn 1-3 (CRITICAL)**: Buy Silver first!
- Starting hand: 7 Copper + 3 Estate = 7 coins
- Buy: Silver (costs 3)
- Why: Silver immediately becomes part of your deck, giving +2 coins every turn
- DON'T: Skip Silver to buy action cards (Village is a TRAP at this point)

**Turns 4-6**: Silver transition (2 Silvers total, ~10 coins/turn)
- Buy another Silver with your improved coins
- You now have 2 Silvers + starting Coppers = consistent 10+ coins/turn

**Turns 7-10**: Gold introduction (2-3 Golds, ~15 coins/turn)
- Your economy is strong; now add Golds for more coin generation
- After this phase, you'll have 15+ coins per turn

**Turns 11-15**: VP introduction (Provinces when 8+ coins available)
- Continue buying Golds if still below 15 coins per turn
- Start buying Provinces once you reliably have 8+ coins

**Turns 16+**: VP focus (Province every turn)
- Economy is maxed; focus entirely on VP
- Buy Province when you have 8+ coins
- Buy Duchy when Province unavailable
- Buy Estate when low coins

## Endgame Recognition and Adaptation

Game ends when Province pile empty OR any 3 piles empty.

**Signals for Endgame**:
- Turn count 20+ (likely endgame approaching)
- 2+ piles have <3 cards (endgame approaching fast)
- Province pile <5 left (endgame very near)
- Any 3 piles combined have <10 cards (danger zone)

**Strategic Adaptation When Endgame Nears**:
- Stop buying treasures entirely
- Focus 100% on VP acquisition
- Buy Province before other piles empty it
- Buy Duchy/Estate aggressively to maximize VP before game ends
- Don't get caught with treasures when game ends

**Example Endgame Pressure**:
- Province: 2 left, Duchy: 3 left, Gold: 2 left
- You have 8 coins
- If you buy Gold, Province might empty next turn (game ends)
- Better: Buy Province now to secure VP

## Common Mistakes

1. **Buying action cards in early game** (Village first = TRAP)
   - With only 4-7 Copper, Village provides +2 actions but nothing to play
   - Silver is always better first (immediate +2 coins/turn forever)
   - Action cards only good when you have synergies to enable

2. Buying VP too early (dilutes deck)
3. Not buying enough treasures (growth stalls)
4. Overcomplicating (Big Money simple wins)
5. Ignoring supply scarcity (game ends at 3 empty)
6. Buying wrong action cards (most aren't worth it)

## Detailed Phase Strategy

### Early Game: Build Economy
- Don't buy Estate, Duchy, Province
- Don't buy action cards
- Buy: Copper (if 7-9 coins), Silver (if 10+), Gold (if 6+)
- Reasoning: VP dilutes. Actions complicate. Treasures compound.

### Mid Game: Acceleration
- Maintain Silver + Gold buying
- Evaluate kingdom cards (Market, Village/Smithy)
- Start buying Province (if 8+ coins)
- Stop buying Estate (wasteful)
- Decision: Treasure > VP > Action by priority

### Late Game: Finishing
- Stop treasures (economy maxed)
- Buy Province every turn (8 coins)
- Buy Duchy if Province unavailable (5 coins)
- Finish with Estates if low coins (2 coins)
- Avoid action cards (too late)

## Strategy Levels

**Level 1: Pure Big Money**
- Only treasures + VP, no actions
- Wins through consistency
- Teaches fundamentals
- Recommended for new players

**Level 2: Kingdom Awareness**
- Buy good action cards (Market, Village/Smithy)
- Recognize card synergies
- Improves win rate
- More complex but rewarding

**Level 3: Expert Play**
- Perfect transition timing
- Sophisticated multi-card chains
- Optimal supply reading
- Requires mastery of levels 1-2

**Recommendation**: Master Level 1 first. Big Money teaches fundamentals through consistent results.

## Common Strategy Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Overthinking**
- Big Money wins through simplicity
- Complex strategies usually lose
- Consistency > Cleverness

**Mistake 2: Ignoring Supply Piles**
- Game ends at 3 empty piles
- Must watch Province pile especially
- Adjust strategy when piles deplete

**Mistake 3: Wrong Action Cards**
- Not all action cards are worth buying
- Only buy if they improve economy/buys
- Skip complex cards when in doubt

## Card Category Strategy

### Treasures
Buy treasures early and mid-game to build economic engine. Each upgrade (Copper → Silver → Gold) takes 3 turns to pay for itself, then improves every future turn.

### Victory Cards
Buy VP only when:
1. Your economy is plateaued (can't improve much)
2. Endgame is approaching (supply piles low)
3. You've accumulated sufficient coins (usually 15+)

Buying VP too early dilutes your deck, reducing coins per turn.

### Action Cards
Buy action cards only when:
1. They generate coins directly
2. They give extra buys (multiplies your purchases)
3. They synergize with other cards (Village + Smithy)

Most action cards complicate decisions. Keep strategy simple.

## Quick Lookup: When to Buy Each Card

| Card | Early | Mid | Late |
|------|-------|-----|------|
| Copper | Yes | No | No |
| Silver | Yes | Yes | Maybe |
| Gold | Yes | Yes | Maybe |
| Estate | No | No | Maybe |
| Duchy | No | Maybe | Yes |
| Province | No | Maybe | Yes |
| Village | Maybe | Maybe | No |
| Smithy | Maybe | Maybe | No |
| Market | Maybe | Maybe | No |

Decision depends on game state and your economy. Master the fundamentals first!

## Strategy Testing Checklist

**Before buying, ask yourself**:
1. What is my current coins per turn?
2. What is the current game turn?
3. How many piles are below 3 cards?
4. Is Province pile getting low?
5. Can I afford my target card?
6. Will this card improve my economy?

**Quick decisions**:
- Early game + low coins? Buy treasures
- Mid-game + medium coins? Buy treasures or Province
- Late game + high coins? Buy Province or Duchy
- Endgame signals? Buy VP only

This mental checklist helps you make consistent strategic decisions that win games.

## Action Card Strategy & Testing (R2.1-ACC)

**Goal**: Develop diverse gameplay while testing action mechanics

### When to Buy Action Cards

**Turn 2-4: Early Action Buying (Optional)**
- If you have 3+ coins available
- Buy Village to enable future action chains
- Don't skip Silver entirely - balance is key

**Turn 5-8: Compound with Smithy**
- Now buy Smithy if you have Village
- Village → Smithy combo in same turn = powerful engine
- This tests multi-action turn mechanics

**Turn 9+: Market Consideration**
- Market (+1 buy) is worth buying late game
- Enables buying 2 cards per turn
- Tests +buy mechanic

### Action Card Play Order (IMPORTANT)

**When you have multiple actions**:
1. **Play Village FIRST** (gives +2 actions)
2. **Then play Smithy** (use the actions from Village)
3. **Then any Market** (uses remaining action)

Example: Village → Smithy → Market = 4 extra cards drawn + all benefits

**Why order matters**: Village must be played first to generate actions for other cards.

### Testing Coverage Goals

**Aim for action card play in ≥50% of games**:
- Tests Village mechanics (action generation)
- Tests Smithy mechanics (card draw)
- Tests Market mechanics (+buy)
- Tests multi-action turn handling

### Pure Big Money Still Wins

Important note: You can win WITHOUT buying any action cards. Big Money (treasures + VP only) is a valid strategy. Action cards are for:
- Gaining variety
- Testing game mechanics
- Exploring deck-building
- Learning card synergies

## Efficiency Tips (Batch Commands & State Management)

**Buy Phase Acceleration** (R2.1-ACC Feature):
- Use `play_treasure all` to play all treasures at once
- Automatically calculates coins
- 5 treasures: <2 seconds (vs 30-40 seconds individually)
- Makes gameplay 40-50% faster

**Trust Auto-Returned State**:
- After every move, the game returns updated state
- No need to call `game_observe` between moves
- Always know: phase, hand, coins, actions, buys, valid moves
- More efficient decision-making

**Efficient Turn Flow**:
```
1. game_observe → see initial turn
2. play_action Village (if available)
3. play_action Smithy (if available + have actions)
4. end → move to Buy phase (auto-return shows coins available)
5. play_treasure all → plays all treasures instantly
6. buy Province (if coins ≥ 8) or Silver (early) or VP (late)
7. end → turn complete (auto-return shows next turn state)
```

**Speed Tips**:
- Use batch commands when available
- Trust the auto-returned state
- Don't hesitate with decisions - just execute
- The system will show valid moves to guide your next action
