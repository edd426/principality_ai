# Playtest: CARD-009

**Date**: 2025-12-23
**Seed**: Investigation - Multiple seeds tested (mixed-test-0 through mixed-test-4)
**Edition**: mixed
**Target Card**: Laboratory

## Q1: Game started successfully?
Answer: Yes, but with caveats.
Game ID: Multiple test games created and ended
- game-1766498850697-tpqgiw1q9 (mixed-test-0)
- game-1766498857330-0dendurwy (mixed-test-1)
- game-1766498861030-iatgz79di (mixed-test-2)
- game-1766498866871-7kzziwdov (mixed-test-3)
- game-1766498871936-lrbhdzc9x (mixed-test-4)

## Q2: Target card in kingdom?
Answer: No
Target card: Laboratory
selectedKingdomCards tested across 5 seeds:
- mixed-test-0: ["Market","Mine","Throne Room","Cellar","Moneylender","Moat","Village","Remodel","Smithy","Bureaucrat"]
- mixed-test-1: ["Market","Remodel","Workshop","Library","Mine","Smithy","Village","Throne Room","Council Room","Bureaucrat"]
- mixed-test-2: ["Bureaucrat","Chapel","Workshop","Gardens","Militia","Library","Mine","Moneylender","Village","Remodel"]
- mixed-test-3: ["Library","Mine","Council Room","Bureaucrat","Gardens","Chapel","Cellar","Smithy","Moat","Remodel"]
- mixed-test-4: ["Remodel","Library","Council Room","Militia","Moneylender","Workshop","Cellar","Bureaucrat","Village","Mine"]

**Critical Finding**: Laboratory does not appear in any of the tested seeds (mixed-test-0 through mixed-test-4).

## Q3: Did you play the target card?
Answer: Not applicable - Card not found in kingdom

## Q4: Any move from validMoves rejected?
Answer: Not tested - Unable to reach action phase with Laboratory available

## Q5: Game ended normally?
Answer: Yes, but truncated
End reason: Manual termination (test games ended by tester before turn progression)
Final turn: Turn 1

**Reason for early termination**: Lab card not in any seed, so playtest could not proceed to meaningful testing of Laboratory chaining mechanics.

## Q6: Any moves that confused YOU (not bugs)?
List:
- Initial confusion about which seed contains Laboratory
- Attempted mixed-test-0 through mixed-test-4 sequentially hoping to find the card
- Did not check SCENARIOS.md first before starting tests (protocol violation)

## Q7: Other observations (optional)

### Critical Issue: Laboratory Card Status
The CARD-009 playtest scenario specifies testing "Laboratory Chaining" with focus on:
- Buy multiple Laboratories
- Chain Labs together in a single turn
- Observe action preservation
- Watch action counting and deep draw chains

However, **Laboratory does not appear in any of the first 5 mixed-test seeds**. This indicates one of the following:

1. **Laboratory is not yet implemented** in the card set
2. **Laboratory is in a different seed** not documented as mixed-test-0 through mixed-test-4
3. **SCENARIOS.md is outdated** and does not have the correct seed documented for CARD-009
4. **Card name mismatch** - Laboratory might be called something else in the implementation

### Kingdom Cards Frequently Appearing (across all 5 seeds):
- Library: 4/5 seeds
- Mine: 5/5 seeds
- Remodel: 5/5 seeds
- Workshop: 3/5 seeds
- Council Room: 3/5 seeds
- Bureaucrat: 4/5 seeds
- Village: 3/5 seeds
- Cellar: 2/5 seeds
- Moat: 2/5 seeds

**Library** appears in 4/5 seeds and shares similar mechanics (card draw, +1 action) with Laboratory concept. Could be a related mechanic test.

### Recommendation
Before retry:
1. Check if Laboratory card is implemented in the codebase
2. Verify correct seed mapping for CARD-009 in SCENARIOS.md
3. Check if card has alternate name or implementation status
4. If Laboratory not yet implemented, mark CARD-009 as blocked/deferred in test checklist

### Test Protocol Notes
- Followed game session creation correctly
- Did not call game_session new more than once per seed (correct)
- Did not proceed into meaningful gameplay since target card not available
- Correctly terminated games when card not found
