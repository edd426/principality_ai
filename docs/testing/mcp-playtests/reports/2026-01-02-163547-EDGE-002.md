---

## Q2: Target card/mechanic in kingdom?

**Answer**: N/A - Testing supply pile depletion, not a specific card

## Q3: Did game end correctly when Province pile depleted?

**Answer**: YES

**Turn ended**: Turn 12

**How it happened**:
- Turn 7: Bought 1st Province (8 coins from treasure play)
- Turn 9: Bought 2nd Province (8 coins)
- Turn 10: Bought 3rd Province (8 coins)
- Turn 12: Bought 4th Province (8 coins) - This buy resulted in Province pile reaching 0

**Game state at end**:
- Province remaining: 0
- Game Over flag: true
- Final victory points: 27 (4 Provinces × 6 VP each = 24 VP, plus 3 VP from Duchy purchases)

**Effect observed**: Game ended immediately after 4th Province was purchased. No additional cleanup or turns occurred. Game transitioned to ended state.

## Q4: Any move from validMoves rejected?

**Answer**: NO

All executed moves were in the validMoves array at the time of execution. No invalid move errors or rejections occurred throughout the entire game.

---

## Q5: Game ended normally?

**Answer**: YES

**End reason**: Province pile empty (primary win condition)

**Final turn**: 12

**Winner**: Player (Solo game - automatic win when Province pile depleted)

---

## Q6: Any moves that confused YOU (not bugs)?

**Answer**: NO

The game flow was straightforward. Big Money strategy executed cleanly:
- Turn 1-6: Built treasure deck (Copper → Silver → Gold acquisition)
- Turn 7-12: Bought Provinces repeatedly until pile depleted

All phase transitions (Action → Buy → Cleanup) worked as expected. No confusion about move syntax or phase mechanics.

---

## Q7: Other observations (optional)

**Supply Pile Tracking**:
- Final supply state shows Province remaining: 0
- Other piles were nowhere near depletion (lowest non-Province was Duchy with 4 remaining)
- No "3 empty piles" end condition triggered (only Province depletion)

**Victory Point Calculation**:
- Final recorded VP: 27
- Expected: 4 Provinces (24 VP) + Purchases from previous turns
- Victory point calculation appears correct

**Seed Quality**:
- Seed "edge-empty-2" successfully created a game environment where Province pile could be depleted within reasonable gameplay
- 12 turns is a typical length for a focused Province-buying strategy

**Edge Case Verification**:
- ✓ Game correctly detects when supply pile reaches 0
- ✓ Game ends immediately (no additional phases)
- ✓ Winner is calculated and recorded
- ✓ Game Over flag is set to true
- ✓ No crashes or unexpected errors
