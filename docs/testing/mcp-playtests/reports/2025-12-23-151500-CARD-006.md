## Q2: Target card in kingdom?
Answer: NO

**Target card**: Witch

**selectedKingdomCards across all seeds tested**:
1. mixed-test-0: [Market, Mine, Throne Room, Cellar, Moneylender, Moat, Village, Remodel, Smithy, Bureaucrat]
2. mixed-test-1: [Market, Remodel, Workshop, Library, Mine, Smithy, Village, Throne Room, Council Room, Bureaucrat]
3. mixed-test-4: [Remodel, Library, Council Room, Militia, Moneylender, Workshop, Cellar, Bureaucrat, Village, Mine]
4. witch-test: [Workshop, Moneylender, Gardens, Festival, Mine, Remodel, Cellar, Bureaucrat, Moat, Village]
5. card-006: [Market, Library, Militia, Moneylender, Mine, Village, Throne Room, Laboratory, Chapel, Festival]
6. witch-curse-test: [Remodel, Moneylender, Bureaucrat, Laboratory, Market, Library, Council Room, Gardens, Festival, Mine]
7. attack-cards-test: [Chapel, Bureaucrat, Market, Throne Room, Cellar, Council Room, Moneylender, Workshop, Festival, Laboratory]

**Critical Finding**: **Witch card does NOT appear in any of the tested kingdom selections**, despite trying 7 different seeds specifically designed to find it.

## Q3: Did you play the target card?
Answer: NOT APPLICABLE

The Witch card was not available in any kingdom, therefore it could not be played or tested.

## Q4: Any move from validMoves rejected?
Answer: NO

All moves executed were from validMoves arrays. No rejection errors occurred.

## Q5: Game ended normally?
Answer: NO

Games were manually ended after Turn 1 due to inability to continue testing without the target card. No natural game end conditions were reached.

End reason: Manual termination - target card unavailable
Final turn: 1

## Q6: Any moves that confused YOU (not bugs)?
List:
- Assumption that seed name `mixed-test-0` would include Witch was incorrect
- Expected Witch to appear based on pre-flight checklist reference table
- Multiple seed attempts with different naming conventions (witch-test, card-006, witch-curse-test, attack-cards-test) all failed to produce Witch

## Q7: Other observations and Analysis

### Critical Issue: Card Implementation Status

**Witch card appears to NOT be implemented or available in the current game build.** This was verified across 7 independent game startups with different seeds.

### Observations on Available Cards

The kingdom selections DO include several attack/curse-related cards:
- **Militia** (found in card-006 seed): Discards opponent cards
- **Bureaucrat** (found in multiple seeds): Attack card

However, **Witch specifically - which gives Curses to opponents - was never selected**.

### Possible Root Causes

1. **Witch is not yet implemented** in the Dominion MVP codebase
2. **Witch is implemented but not included in kingdom card selection pool**
3. **Seed mechanism does not guarantee specific cards** and the pre-flight checklist reference table may be outdated
4. **Card naming issue**: Witch may be named differently (e.g., "Sorceress", "Hexer")

### Implications for CARD-006 Playtest

**Status**: CANNOT BE COMPLETED

The CARD-006 scenario cannot be executed as designed because:
- The target card (Witch) does not appear in the available kingdom
- No curse-giving mechanic can be tested without the card
- Curse pile depletion cannot be verified
- Solo mode curse distribution behavior cannot be observed

### Recommendation

Before attempting this playtest again:
1. Verify Witch card is implemented in the codebase
2. Update SCENARIOS.md with correct seed that guarantees Witch appearance
3. Or substitute CARD-006 test with CARD-007 (Militia) which IS available in the current build
4. Check if Witch requires special edition flags or configuration

### Cards Successfully Observed in Tested Seeds

Attack/Curse-Related Cards That DID Appear:
- Militia (appears in seeds: card-006, mixed-test-4)
- Bureaucrat (appears in multiple seeds)

Other cards observed:
- Chapel, Council Room, Laboratory, Festival, Market, Village, Throne Room, Mine, Cellar, Workshop, Remodel, Library, Moneylender, Moat, Gardens

## Summary

**Playtest Outcome**: BLOCKED - Target card not available

**Bug Status**: Unable to determine. Witch absence may indicate:
1. Implementation gap (card not coded)
2. Configuration issue (card excluded from seed)
3. Documentation issue (SCENARIOS.md reference outdated)

**Next Steps**: Coordinate with dev team to verify Witch implementation status before reattempting CARD-006 playtest.
