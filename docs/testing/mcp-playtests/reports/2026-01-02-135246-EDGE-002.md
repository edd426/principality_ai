## Q4: Any move from validMoves rejected?

Answer: **NO**

All 16 turns executed without errors:
- Turn 1: play_treasure all → buy Silver → end
- Turns 2-8: Standard big money progression
- Turn 9: Earned 9 coins, bought Province
- Turns 10-14: Continued building treasure economy
- Turn 15: Earned 9 coins, bought Province
- Turn 16: Earned 8 coins, bought final Province

Every move executed was present in validMoves array. No syntax errors, no invalid move rejections.

## Q5: Game ended normally?

Answer: **YES**

End condition met: Province pile empty (primary win condition)

Turn progression:

- Turns 2-8: Built treasures (Silver, Gold acquisition)
- Turn 9: First Province purchase
- Turns 10-14: Continued building
- Turn 15: Third Province purchase
- Turn 16: Fourth Province purchase → Game ended
- Final turn: 16 (well under 20-turn limit)

No timeout, no stuck states, no unexpected phase transitions.

## Q6: Winner calculated correctly?

Answer: **YES**

Final scoring calculated:
- Provinces in deck: 4 × 6 VP = 24 VP
- Estates in deck: 3 × 1 VP = 3 VP
- **Total Victory Points: 27 VP**

Displayed in game state: stats.victoryPoints = 27

This correctly reflects the province-focused strategy used in the test.

## Q7: Other observations

**Edge Case Behavior - EXCELLENT**:

1. **Precise Game End Detection**: Game recognized Province pile = 0 and terminated immediately after the purchase. No off-by-one errors.

2. **State Consistency**: All supply piles accurately decremented. Final supply state showed:
   - Province: 0 (was 4, all purchased)
   - Silver: 34 (was 40, 6 purchased across 4 transactions)
   - Gold: 25 (was 30, 5 purchased across 4 transactions)
   - Copper: 60 (unchanged, not purchased with limited coins)

3. **Phase Handling**: Cleanup phase auto-skipped correctly on every turn. No manual cleanup moves required.

4. **Batch Treasure Command**: `play_treasure all` executed flawlessly on every turn, calculating coin totals accurately each time.

5. **Strategic Progression**: Big Money strategy executed without errors:
   - Early: Built Copper/Copper/Copper economy
   - Mid: Introduced Silver cards
   - Late: Introduced Gold cards
   - Final: Focused on Province purchases

**EDGE-002 TEST PASSED**: Empty supply pile edge case handled correctly with proper game end detection and winner calculation.
