## Deck Evolution

**Starting Deck (Turn 1)**:
- 7 Copper (starting treasure)
- 3 Estate (starting victory cards)

**After Turn 4**:
- 4 Copper, 2 Estate, 3 Silver, 1 Gold
- Shift from purely base treasures to upgraded treasures

**After Turn 10**:
- 4 Copper, 2 Estate, 4 Silver, 5 Gold, 1 Province
- Successfully transitioned to victory card acquisition

## Strategy Execution

**Buy Rules Applied**:
- Turn 1-3: Silver purchases (3+ coins available)
- Turn 4+: Gold purchases (6+ coins available)
- Turn 10: Province purchase (8+ coins available, first VP card)

**Coin Generation Pattern**:
- Early turns: 3-4 coins per turn (base treasures only)
- Mid turns (4-8): 6-7 coins per turn (Silver + Copper mix)
- Late turns (9-10): 7-8 coins per turn (Gold + Silver mix)

## Game Mechanics - All Working Correctly

1. **Phase Transitions**: action → buy → cleanup cycled correctly every turn
2. **Treasure Playing**: `play_treasure all` batch command executed flawlessly, auto-calculating coin totals
3. **Card Purchasing**: All buy commands executed successfully, deck automatically updated
4. **Draw/Cleanup**: Deck reshuffled correctly when draw pile exhausted
5. **Valid Moves**: All moves sent were in validMoves array; no invalid move errors

## Bugs Found

**None**. Zero errors encountered across all 10 turns.

## UX Observations (Positive)

1. **Batch Treasure Command**: `play_treasure all` dramatically accelerated gameplay - 5 treasures played in single command vs 5 separate commands
2. **Coin Calculation**: System correctly calculated total coins from mixed treasure types (Copper, Silver, Gold)
3. **Game State Feedback**: Each response included clear currentCoins, currentBuys, and phase information
4. **Phase Clarity**: Transitions between phases were explicit and unambiguous

## Strategy Notes

Pure Big Money proved viable and executable:
- By turn 4, player had bought 3 Silver cards
- By turn 7, player had bought 3 Gold cards
- By turn 10, player achieved first Province (VP card) at 8 coins
- Coin generation trajectory: 4→3→3→7→4→7→6→7→7→8

The strategy correctly prioritizes:
1. Early: Copper → Silver transition (turns 1-3)
2. Mid: Silver → Gold transition (turns 4-8)
3. Late: Gold → Province transition (turns 9+)

## Conclusion

STRAT-001 (Pure Big Money) completed successfully with no technical issues. The game engine correctly implements:
- Phase flow (action → buy → cleanup)
- Treasure mechanics (playing → coin generation)
- Card purchasing and deck building
- Batch command acceleration

Ready for more complex strategy testing and multiplayer scenarios.
