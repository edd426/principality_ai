## Q1: Game started successfully?

**Answer**: Yes

**Game ID**: game-1766500720287-07lnf9dw8

**Details**: Game initialized with seed "mixed-test-0" and edition "mixed". Starting hand was 7 Copper + 3 Estate as expected. Game began in action phase on Turn 1.

## Q2: Target card in kingdom?

**Answer**: N/A (No specific target card - basic game flow test)

**Selected Kingdom Cards**: Market, Mine, Throne Room, Cellar, Moneylender, Moat, Village, Remodel, Smithy, Bureaucrat

**Details**: This was a basic gameplay test, not focused on a specific card. All 10 kingdom cards were available as expected. The game had full access to treasures (Copper, Silver, Gold), victory cards (Estate, Duchy, Province), and action cards.

---

## Q3: Did you play the target card?

**Answer**: N/A (No target card for this test)

**Details**: Focused on basic Big Money strategy - buying treasures and victory cards. No action cards were played during the game. The test was intentionally simple to validate core mechanics.

## Q4: Any move from validMoves rejected?

**Answer**: Yes (1 minor issue)

**Turn**: 20

**Move sent**: `buy Duchy`

**Error received**: "Invalid move: 'buy Duchy' is not legal in current game state. Valid purchases: Copper, Curse, Cellar, Estate, Moat, Silver, Village, Bureaucrat, Moneylender, Remodel, Smithy, Throne Room, Market, Mine."

**Was move in validMoves?**: No - Duchy was not in the valid moves list because the Duchy pile had been depleted by turn 20.

**Assessment**: NOT A BUG. This is correct behavior. The game properly prevented buying from an empty pile. The error message was clear. I simply bought Silver instead, which was valid.

---

## Q5: Game ended normally?

**Answer**: Yes

**End reason**: Reached turn 20 as specified in test protocol

**Final turn**: 21 (cleanup phase of turn 20)

**Details**: Game did not end due to province depletion or 3-pile empty condition. I intentionally ended the game after turn 20 per the test protocol. The game was still ongoing and playable - no errors or stuck states were encountered.

---

## Q6: Any moves that confused YOU (not bugs)?

**Answer**: No

**Details**: All moves executed as expected. The batch `play_treasure all` command was extremely efficient. Phase transitions were clear (action → buy → cleanup). No confusion about legal moves or game state.

## Q7: Other observations

### System Stability
- Game ran without crashes or errors for 20 full turns
- State management was consistent - hand, discard, deck tracked correctly
- Auto-skipping of cleanup phase worked as intended

### Batch Command Efficiency
- `play_treasure all` worked perfectly and was much faster than individual plays
- Automatically calculated correct coin totals (e.g., 5 treasures → 10 coins)
- Recommendation: This batch command should be standard practice for treasure play

### Game Mechanics Observed
1. **Coin Economy**: Treasure progression (Copper → Silver → Gold) worked correctly
2. **Supply Depletion**: Duchy pile depleted naturally by turn 20, showing proper supply tracking
3. **Victory Cards**: Successfully bought 2 Provinces and multiple Duchies
4. **Economic Growth**: Coin generation increased predictably over time
5. **Big Money Strategy**: Simple treasure + VP strategy worked as expected to generate 10+ coins by mid-game

### Final Deck Composition (Turn 20)
- Hand: Silver, Estate, Copper, Estate, Duchy
- Discard Pile: 2 Provinces, 5 Duchies, 8 Silvers, 6 Coppers, 1 Gold, 2 Estates
- VP Cards Total: 2 Provinces (12 VP) + 5 Duchies (15 VP) + 1 Estate in hand (1 VP) = 28 VP total

### Validation Results
- Edition parameter enforcement: WORKING (had to specify "mixed" or hook would reject)
- Seed system: WORKING (mixed-test-0 produced valid 10-card kingdom)
- Move validation: WORKING (invalid moves rejected with clear messages)
- Phase management: WORKING (correct transitions and auto-skipping)
- Batch commands: WORKING (all treasures played correctly)

## Summary

**Status**: PASS - No bugs detected

The basic Dominion game flow executed successfully for 20 turns with proper:
- Game state management
- Phase transitions
- Supply tracking
- Move validation
- Batch command execution

All core mechanics functioned as expected. The pre-flight checklist validation (edition parameter hook) also worked correctly, enforcing edition specification.

Recommendation: System is stable for continued testing of specific card mechanics.
