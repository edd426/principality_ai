## Council Room Mechanics Verification

### Turn 5 Test (First Play)
**Before**: hand={Copper:4, Council Room:1} | actions=1 | buys=1
**After playing Council Room**: hand={Copper:5, Estate:2, Silver:1} | actions=0 | buys=2
**Verification**:
- Cards drawn: 4 cards ✓ (hand went from 5 to 8, minus 1 for card played = +4)
- Buy bonus: +1 ✓ (buys incremented 1→2)
- Action consumption: -1 ✓ (actions decremented 1→0)

### Turn 10 Test (Second Play)
**Before**: hand={Council Room:1, Copper:2, Silver:1, Estate:1} | actions=1 | buys=1
**After playing Council Room**: hand={Copper:6, Silver:1, Estate:1} | actions=0 | buys=2
**Verification**:
- Cards drawn: 4 cards ✓ (consistent behavior)
- Buy bonus: +1 ✓ (buys incremented 1→2 again)
- Action consumption: -1 ✓ (actions decremented correctly)

## Key Observations

1. **Card Draw Accuracy**: Council Room consistently drew exactly 4 additional cards both times it was played, confirming the +4 cards mechanic works correctly regardless of deck state.

2. **Buy Counter**: The +1 buy mechanic functioned perfectly in both scenarios, allowing two purchases in the buy phase instead of the normal single purchase.

3. **Dual-Buy Execution**: Both test turns successfully used both buys:
   - Turn 5: Bought Gold (6 cost) + Copper (0 cost) with 7 coins available
   - Turn 10: Bought Province (8 cost) + Copper (0 cost) with 8 coins available

4. **Large Hand Handling**: At turn 5, the hand reached 8 cards (Copper×5, Estate×2, Silver×1) with no display or processing issues. No hand size limits were encountered.

5. **Integration with Treasure Playing**: Council Room works seamlessly with the `play_treasure all` batch command. When Council Room draws treasures, they can be immediately played in the same turn's buy phase.

6. **Deck Building Impact**: Acquiring Council Room early (Turn 4) accelerated deck development by providing additional card draw and buy opportunities, allowing faster accumulation of victory points (first Province on Turn 9, second on Turn 13, third on Turn 15).

## Bugs Found

**None** - All tests passed without errors. The card mechanics are functioning as intended.

---

## UX Observations (Suggestions)

1. **Hand Size Display**: Consider displaying hand size indicator (e.g., "Hand: 8 cards") to make large draws more visible during gameplay.

2. **Buy Counter Clarity**: When +1 buy is granted, a brief notification like "✓ +1 Buy" could make the mechanic more salient to the player.

3. **Action Phase with Treasures**: The system correctly prevents treasure plays in action phase, which is good UX design.
