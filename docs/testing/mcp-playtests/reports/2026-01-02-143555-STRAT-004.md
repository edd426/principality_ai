# Playtest: STRAT-004 (Trasher Strategy - Chapel)

**Date**: 2026-01-02
**Seed**: mixed-test-0
**Edition**: mixed

## Q1: Game started successfully?
Answer: Yes
Game ID: game-1767338155364-jai0misvd

## Q2: Target card in kingdom?
Answer: No
Target card: Chapel
selectedKingdomCards: ["Workshop","Feast","Chancellor","Remodel","Adventurer","Festival","Cellar","Witch","Spy","Smithy"]

**ISSUE**: The test instructions specified seed "mixed-test-0", but Chapel is not in this kingdom. According to SCENARIOS.md documentation, Chapel requires seed "mixed-test-4". This is a test configuration error, not a game bug.

## Q3: Did you play the target card?
Answer: Not applicable
Turn played: N/A
Effect observed: Chapel was not available in the kingdom, so it could not be bought or played. Additionally, game execution was blocked by a separate critical bug (see Q4).

## Q4: Any move from validMoves rejected?
Answer: No - but there is a CRITICAL BUG with move execution

**CRITICAL BUG FOUND**:
- Turn: 1
- Move sent: "end" (from validMoves array)
- Error received: None - reports success: true
- Was move in validMoves? Yes

**Bug Description**:
The `game_execute` tool has a severe bug where:

1. Command sent: `game_execute(move: "end")`
2. Response received: `{"success": true, "gameState": {"phase": "action", "turnNumber": 19, ...}}`
3. Actual state (verified via `game_observe`): `{"phase": "action", "turnNumber": 1, ...}` (unchanged)

The execute command reports success and returns fabricated future game states (turn 19, turn 20), but the actual game state remains frozen at turn 1. Repeated attempts with both "end" and "end_phase" show the same pattern:
- Execute returns success with fake turn numbers
- Observe confirms game hasn't progressed at all
- Hand remains identical (4 Copper, 1 Estate)

**Evidence**:
```
Execute attempt 1: Response shows turn 19
Execute attempt 2: Response shows turn 20
Observe (after both): Still turn 1, same hand
```

This makes the game completely unplayable - no turns can advance beyond turn 1.

## Q5: Game ended normally?
Answer: No
End reason: Game stuck at turn 1 - could not progress due to bug in Q4
Final turn: 1 (frozen)

## Q6: Any moves that confused YOU (not bugs)?
List:
- Initially confused by execute responses showing turn 18, 19, 20 when game was actually stuck at turn 1
- This confusion was resolved by cross-referencing with game_observe, which revealed the bug
- No mistakes on my part - followed validMoves exactly

## Q7: Other observations

### Bug Severity: CRITICAL
This bug completely blocks gameplay. The MCP server's game_execute function appears to be:
1. Accepting valid moves from validMoves
2. Reporting success
3. Returning hallucinated game states with incorrect turn numbers
4. Not actually updating the underlying game state

### Test Configuration Issue
The test requested seed "mixed-test-0" for testing Chapel, but:
- Chapel is NOT in mixed-test-0 kingdom
- SCENARIOS.md documents Chapel in seed "mixed-test-4"
- Future tests should verify seed/card mapping before starting

### Recommendation
1. Fix the game_execute bug as highest priority - game is unplayable
2. Update STRAT-004 test instructions to use correct seed (mixed-test-4) for Chapel testing
3. After bug fix, re-run this test with correct seed to actually test Chapel mechanics

### Unable to Test
Due to the combination of:
- Wrong seed (no Chapel in kingdom)
- Critical game_execute bug (game frozen at turn 1)

No actual Chapel trashing mechanics could be tested. Test must be re-run after bugs are fixed.
