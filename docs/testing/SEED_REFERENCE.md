# Seed Reference for Reproducible Testing

> Auto-generated by `scripts/discover-seeds.ts`

## How Seeds Work

- Any string seed produces a deterministic game
- Same seed + same moves = identical game progression
- Seeds affect: starting deck shuffle, kingdom card selection

## Usage

```bash
# CLI
npm run play --seed=chapel-seed-0

# MCP
game_session(command="new", seed="chapel-seed-0")
```
