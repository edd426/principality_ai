## Test Focus

This playtest specifically tested the Remodel card's two-step mechanic:
1. Trash a card from hand
2. Gain a card costing up to $2 more than the trashed card

### Scenarios Tested

#### Scenario 1: Trash Copper, Gain Estate (Turn 6)
- **Trashed:** Copper ($0)
- **Gained:** Estate ($2)
- **Result:** SUCCESS
  - System correctly prompted to choose card to trash
  - Only Copper cards were available in hand
  - After trashing, system prompted for gain options up to $2
  - Available gain options: Copper ($0), Curse ($0), Cellar ($2), Chapel ($2), Estate ($2)
  - Successfully gained Estate
  - VP increased from 3 VP (3E) to 4 VP (4E)

#### Scenario 2: Trash Estate, Gain Silver (Turn 8)
- **Trashed:** Estate ($2)
- **Gained:** Silver ($3)
- **Result:** SUCCESS
  - System correctly prompted with both Estate and Copper as trash options
  - Successfully selected Estate to trash
  - Available gain options included cards up to $4: Copper, Curse, Cellar, Chapel, Estate, Silver, Workshop, Bureaucrat, Moneylender, Remodel
  - Successfully gained Silver
  - VP decreased from 4 VP (4E) to 3 VP (3E) - correctly lost the Estate
  - Silver supply decreased from 35 to 34

## Questionnaire

### Q1: Did the game initialize correctly?
Answer: Yes
If No, what happened: N/A

Notes: First seed (remodel-test-001) did not include Remodel in kingdom. Switched to seed "remodel-001" which included Remodel in the kingdom cards.

### Q2: Were the Available Moves always clear?
Answer: Yes
If No, describe unclear moments: N/A

Notes: The Remodel card's two-step process was very clear. The system showed "Trash:" options first, then after selection showed "Gain:" options with the correct cost calculations.

### Q3: Did playing treasures correctly increase your Coins?
Answer: Yes
If No, describe what happened: N/A

Notes: Treasures worked perfectly throughout. The "Play ALL Treasures" shortcut ([T]) was very helpful.

### Q4: Did the turn number advance at the expected times?
Answer: Yes
If No, when did it advance unexpectedly: N/A

Expected: Turn advances after Cleanup Phase
Notes: Turns advanced correctly. Went from Turn 1 to Turn 21 during the playtest.

### Q5: Did phase transitions work correctly?
Answer: Yes
If No, describe the issue: N/A

Expected: Action → Buy → Cleanup → Next Turn
Notes: Phase transitions worked perfectly. Remodel's effect happened during Action Phase, then Buy Phase proceeded normally.

### Q6: Were you ever confused about what to do?
Answer: No
If Yes, describe the confusion and how you resolved it: N/A

Notes: The Remodel prompts were extremely clear. The "Trash:" and "Gain:" prefixes made it obvious what was happening at each step.

### Q7: Did any moves produce unexpected results?
Answer: No
If Yes, list the move and what happened: N/A

Notes: Remodel worked exactly as expected in both test scenarios.

### Q8: Did any error messages appear?
Answer: No
If Yes, quote the error and what caused it: N/A

### Q9: Rate the overall clarity of the CLI (1-5)
Score: 5/5
Comments: Excellent. The two-step Remodel process was handled beautifully. The system correctly:
- Prompted for trash selection with only valid cards
- Calculated the +$2 cost bonus correctly
- Showed only cards within the cost range for gaining
- Updated VP and supply counts immediately

### Q10: Any other observations?

**Positive Observations:**
1. The Remodel implementation is robust and clear
2. The cost calculation (+$2 bonus) worked perfectly in both scenarios
3. The VP tracking correctly reflected gaining/losing victory cards
4. The supply counts updated correctly
5. The move prompts clearly distinguished between "Trash:" and "Gain:" steps

**Testing Coverage:**
- Successfully tested trashing a $0 card (Copper) → gain up to $2
- Successfully tested trashing a $2 card (Estate) → gain up to $4
- Did not test trashing a $3 card (Silver) → gain up to $5 due to not drawing that scenario

**Potential Future Tests:**
- Trash Silver ($3) → Gain cards up to $5 (Festival, Mine, Duchy, etc.)
- Trash Gold ($6) → Gain cards up to $8 (Province)
- Test Remodel when no valid gain targets exist in supply

## Game Summary

Final VP: 3 VP (3E)
Cards bought: Silver (multiple), Gold (1), Remodel (1)
Strategy notes: Focused on buying Remodel and testing its mechanic rather than optimizing for victory. Successfully demonstrated two different Remodel scenarios (trash Copper, trash Estate).

## Key Findings

### What Worked Well
1. Remodel's two-step trash-then-gain mechanic is implemented correctly
2. Cost calculations for the "+$2 bonus" work perfectly
3. Available moves list updates correctly at each step
4. VP tracking reflects gaining/losing victory cards immediately
5. Supply counts update properly

### No Issues Found
The Remodel implementation appears to be working flawlessly. The CLI handles the complex two-step mechanic with excellent clarity.

### Recommendation
Remodel is working correctly and ready for use. The implementation successfully handles:
- Multi-step card effects
- Cost calculations with bonuses
- Dynamic move availability based on card costs
- Immediate state updates (VP, supply, hand)
