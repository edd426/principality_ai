# CLI Phase 2 Requirements - Executive Summary

**Status**: COMPLETE ‚úÖ
**Created**: 2025-10-05
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-20 (marked complete - all features implemented and tested)
**Phase**: 1.5
**Version**: 2.0.0

---

## Overview

All user clarifications received. Six CLI UX improvement features are fully specified and ready for implementation. All open questions have been resolved.

**Total Estimated Effort**: 28 hours (6-7 days)

---

## Feature Summary (6 Features)

### 1. Auto-Play All Treasures ‚ú® Must-Have

**Problem**: Playing 5 Copper cards one-by-one is tedious

**Solution**: Command-based treasure playing - type `treasures` or `t` to play all at once

**User Decision**: Command-based (NOT automatic)
- User must type command to play all treasures
- Preserves individual treasure playing option
- Maintains full player control

**Example**:
```
> treasures
‚úì Played all treasures: Copper (+$1), Copper (+$1), Silver (+$2)
Total coins: $4
```

**Impact**: Eliminates 50-80% of manual inputs per game

**Effort**: 4 hours

---

### 2. Stable Card Numbers üéØ Should-Have

**Problem**: AI agents struggle when "Play Village" changes from [1] to [3] between turns

**Solution**: Fixed numbers that never change

**User Decision**: Simple stable-only display (no hybrid)
- Just show stable numbers: `[7] Play Village`
- Cleaner, simpler UI
- Enabled via `--stable-numbers` flag

**Example**:
```
Turn 1:
  [7] Play Village    ‚Üê Always [7]
  [6] Play Smithy     ‚Üê Always [6]

Turn 5:
  [7] Play Village    ‚Üê Still [7]!
```

**Impact**: AI agents can learn "always pick 7 for Village"

**Effort**: 6 hours (reduced from 8 - simpler without hybrid)

---

### 3. Multi-Card Chained Submission ‚ö° Should-Have

**Problem**: Executing 5 moves requires 5 separate inputs

**Solution**: Accept comma or space-separated move chains

**User Decision**: Full rollback on any error
- If ANY move fails, rollback ALL moves
- Game state unchanged if chain fails
- Detailed error message showing which move failed

**Example**:
```
> 1, 2, 3

‚úì Played Village
‚úì Played Smithy
‚úì Ended Action Phase
```

**Error Handling**:
```
> 1, 99
‚úó Chain failed at move 2: Invalid move number (99).
  All moves rolled back. Game state unchanged.
```

**Impact**: 60-70% faster gameplay for common sequences

**Effort**: 8 hours (increased from 6 - rollback adds complexity)

---

### 4. Reduced Supply Pile Sizes üé≤ Could-Have

**Problem**: Testing 20-turn games is slow during development

**Solution**: `--quick-game` flag reduces victory piles only

**User Decision**: Provinces confirmed (not "principalities")
- Reduce Estates, Duchies, Provinces from 12 ‚Üí 8
- Villages are kingdom cards, stay at 10
- All kingdom cards stay at 10
- Treasures unchanged

**Example**:
```bash
npm run play -- --quick-game
```

**Impact**: Games finish in 10-15 turns instead of 20-25 (40% faster)

**Effort**: 2 hours

---

### 5. Victory Points Display üèÜ Must-Have (NEW)

**Problem**: Victory points were completely missing from Phase 1 CLI

**Solution**: Display VP in game status header at all times

**User Discovery**: "Please add to the UI something that shows the number of victory points. I noticed this was missing from the cli ui."

**Example**:
```
=== Turn 5 | Player 1 | VP: 5 (3E, 1D) | Action Phase ===
```

Or expanded format:
```
=== Turn 5 | Player 1 | Action Phase ===
Victory Points: 5 VP (2 Estates, 1 Duchy)
```

**Impact**: Essential game information now visible

**Effort**: 5 hours

---

### 6. Auto-Skip Cleanup Phase ‚ö° Should-Have

**Problem**: Players must manually press a key every turn to execute cleanup even though no decisions are required

**Solution**: Automatically execute cleanup and advance to next turn when no choices exist

**Example**:
```
‚úì Cleanup: Discarded 3 cards, drew 5 new cards

=== Turn 2 | Player 1 | Action Phase ===
```

**Opt-Out**: `--manual-cleanup` flag disables auto-skip

**Impact**: Eliminates one manual input per turn, smoother game flow

**Effort**: 3 hours

---

## All Questions Resolved ‚úÖ

### Question 1: "Principalities" Clarification
**Answer**: "Yes, I meant Provinces"
- Confirmed: Reduce Estates, Duchies, Provinces to 8
- Villages stay at 10 (kingdom card, not victory card)

### Question 2: Auto-Play Behavior
**Answer**: "No, treasures require a command to play all"
- Command-based, NOT automatic
- User types `treasures` or `t` or `play all`
- Can still play individually

### Question 3: Stable Numbering Display
**Answer**: "For simplicity, just show the stable numbering please"
- Simple display only: `[7] Play Village`
- No hybrid with sequential numbers
- Remove old numbered display entirely

### Question 4: Chain Error Handling
**Answer**: "If move 2 fails, stop and reset as though none of the moves in the chain have happened"
- Full rollback/transaction behavior
- If ANY move fails, revert ALL moves
- Detailed error message
- Game state unchanged

### Question 5: Victory Points (NEW FEATURE)
**Answer**: "Also, please add to the UI something that shows the number of victory points"
- Missing from Phase 1
- Must-have feature
- Show in game header
- Update after buying victory cards

### Question 6: Auto-Skip Cleanup (NEW FEATURE)
**Observation**: User identified cleanup phase requires manual input despite having no choices
- Auto-execute cleanup when only one move option exists
- Display cleanup summary
- Opt-out via `--manual-cleanup` flag
- Future-proof for cards with cleanup decisions
