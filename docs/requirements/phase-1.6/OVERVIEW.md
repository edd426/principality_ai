# Phase 1.6 Overview: Card Help Lookup System

**Status**: DRAFT
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Phase**: 1.6
**Estimated Effort**: 6-8 hours

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 1.6 completes the MVP base game by implementing an **interactive card help lookup system**. This feature provides essential reference functionality that allows both human and AI players to query card details during gameplay.

**Core Problem**: Players currently have no way to look up what cards do during a game. This is a critical gap in base game functionality—you can't effectively play a card game if you can't reference card effects.

**Solution**: Add two CLI commands (`help <card>` and `cards`) that provide instant access to card information (cost, type, and effect description) for all 15 cards in the game.

**Value Proposition**: This is NOT a "nice to have" UX enhancement—it's essential MVP functionality that should have been included in Phase 1. Without it, players must memorize all card effects or consult external documentation.

## Phase 1.6 Vision

### What Phase 1.6 IS

✅ **MVP Completion Feature**: Adds missing base game functionality
✅ **Information Access**: Instant card reference during gameplay
✅ **Universal Interface**: Same commands for human and AI players
✅ **Foundation for Phase 2**: Text-based help prepares for MCP structured data

### What Phase 1.6 Is NOT

❌ **Not a major feature expansion**: Small, focused scope (6-8 hours)
❌ **Not about new cards**: Uses existing 15 cards in system
❌ **Not MCP integration yet**: Phase 2 will add structured data for LLMs
❌ **Not optional polish**: This is required MVP functionality

---

## Problem Statement

### Current State (Phase 1.5)

**What Works:**
- Core game engine with immutable state pattern
- 15 cards implemented (8 kingdom + 7 base cards)
- Excellent CLI UX with auto-play, multi-card chains, stable numbers
- 95%+ test coverage with comprehensive test suite
- Clean separation: core package (engine) + cli package (interface)

**Critical Gap:**
- ❌ No way to look up card details during gameplay
- ❌ No card catalog or reference system
- ❌ Players must memorize all 15 card effects
- ❌ AI agents have no programmatic way to query card capabilities

### User Impact

**Human Players:**
- "What does Remodel do again?"
- "How much does Market cost?"
- "Is Estate an action or victory card?"
- **Current solution**: Exit game, check code or docs, restart game

**AI Players (Phase 2 Preparation):**
- LLM agents need card knowledge to make strategic decisions
- No way to query "What cards can I buy with 5 coins?"
- No reference for "Which cards give +Actions?"
- **Current solution**: Must embed all card knowledge in system prompt (inefficient)

### Why This Wasn't in Phase 1

Phase 1 focused on core game mechanics with human players who could reference documentation externally. However, for true "playability" and AI integration readiness, in-game reference is essential.

## Phase 1.6 Goals

### Primary Goals

1. **Information Access**: Provide instant access to card details during gameplay
2. **Universal Interface**: Same commands work for human and AI players
3. **Complete Coverage**: All 15 cards (kingdom + base) have help text
4. **Seamless Integration**: Commands available anytime without interrupting game flow

### Success Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
- ✅ `help <card>` command displays cost, type, and effect for any card
- ✅ `cards` command displays table of all available cards
- ✅ Commands work during action phase, buy phase, and between turns
- ✅ Help text stored in core package alongside card logic
- ✅ Case-insensitive card name matching

**Quality Requirements:**
- ✅ Lookup performance < 5ms (negligible impact on gameplay)
- ✅ Maintain 95%+ test coverage from Phase 1/1.5
- ✅ Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- ✅ Clear error messages for unknown cards
- ✅ Consistent formatting and presentation

**Documentation Requirements:**
- ✅ All CLI commands documented in README
- ✅ Examples in DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE
- ✅ Help text for all 15 cards
- ✅ UX guide with visual examples

### Non-Goals (Deferred to Later Phases)

❌ **JSON output format**: Phase 2 (MCP integration) will add structured data
❌ **Advanced search**: No filtering by cost, type, or effect keywords
❌ **Card recommendations**: No "suggest cards" or strategic advice
❌ **Custom card descriptions**: No per-player customization
❌ **Interactive tutorials**: No guided learning system

## Relationship to Roadmap

### Project Phases

**Phase 1 (Complete)**: Core game engine + 8 kingdom cards
**Phase 1.5 (Complete)**: CLI UX improvements (6 features)
**➡️ Phase 1.6 (Current)**: Card help lookup system ⬅️
**Phase 2 (Next)**: MCP server integration for LLM gameplay
**Phase 3**: Multiplayer with AI opponents
**Phase 4**: Web UI with drag-and-drop interface
**Phase 5+**: Advanced cards, tournaments, mobile apps

### Why Phase 1.6 Before Phase 2

**Phase 2 (MCP Integration) Requires:**
1. **Card knowledge system**: LLMs need to query available cards
2. **Structured data export**: Convert help text to JSON for API
3. **Reference implementation**: Text-based help informs MCP design

**Phase 1.6 Provides:**
1. ✅ Help text for all cards in core package
2. ✅ Proven command interface (`help`, `cards`)
3. ✅ Foundation for structured data conversion

**Bottom Line**: Phase 1.6 completes the MVP and unblocks Phase 2.

## Feature Scope

### Features Included

**Feature 1: `help <card>` Command** (3-4 hours)
- Display cost, type, and effect for a specific card
- Alias: `h` for quick access
- Case-insensitive matching
- Error handling for unknown cards

**Feature 2: `cards` Catalog Command** (2-3 hours)
- Table format with columns: Name | Cost | Type | Effect
- Shows all 15 cards (kingdom + base)
- Clean, readable formatting
- Available anytime during game

**Feature 3: Data Model Updates** (1 hour)
- Ensure all cards have `description` field populated
- Consistent help text formatting
- Validation that no cards are missing descriptions

### Card Coverage

**Kingdom Cards (8):**
- Village, Smithy, Laboratory, Festival
- Market, Woodcutter, Council Room, Cellar

**Base Cards (7):**
- Copper, Silver, Gold (Treasures)
- Estate, Duchy, Province (Victory)
- Curse (Curse)

**Total**: 15 cards

## Implementation Approach

### Technical Strategy

**Core Package (`packages/core/`)**:
- Add/update `description` field in card definitions
- Export card metadata for CLI consumption
- No new game logic—purely informational

**CLI Package (`packages/cli/`)**:
- Add command parser for `help` and `cards`
- Implement table formatting for catalog view
- Add help text display logic
- Integrate with existing command loop

**Testing**:
- Unit tests for help text retrieval
- Integration tests for CLI commands
- Test all 15 cards individually
- Error handling tests

### Why This Approach

**1. Data Location (cards.ts)**:
- Help text lives with card definitions (single source of truth)
- Easy to keep descriptions synchronized with implementation
- Simple to extend for new cards in future phases

**2. Command Design**:
- `help <card>` follows convention (git help, npm help, etc.)
- `cards` is intuitive for catalog browsing
- Short alias (`h`) for frequent use

**3. Text-First Design**:
- Human-readable output for Phase 1.6
- Easy to convert to JSON for Phase 2 MCP
- Keeps scope small and focused

## Appendix: Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why is this Phase 1.6 and not part of Phase 1?**
A: Phase 1 focused on core mechanics with the assumption that players would reference external docs. In practice, in-game help is essential for both human and AI players.

**Q: Why not wait until Phase 2 (MCP) to add this?**
A: Phase 2 needs this functionality as a foundation. Also, human players need it NOW for the MVP to be truly playable.

**Q: Will this work for AI agents in Phase 2?**
A: Yes! Phase 2 will convert the text help to structured JSON, but the underlying card knowledge system starts here.

**Q: Can we add strategic advice to the help text?**
A: Not in Phase 1.6 (keep scope small). Strategic hints can be added in Phase 3+ if desired.

**Q: What if we add more cards later?**
A: The system is extensible—just add descriptions to new card definitions in cards.ts.

**Q: Will this slow down gameplay?**
A: No. Lookup is < 5ms and doesn't interrupt game flow. Players use it on-demand.

## Conclusion

Phase 1.6 is a small but critical feature that completes the MVP base game. By adding card help lookup, we:

1. ✅ Provide essential reference functionality for players
2. ✅ Prepare the foundation for Phase 2 MCP integration
3. ✅ Maintain high quality and test coverage standards
4. ✅ Keep scope focused and achievable (6-8 hours)

This is the final MVP piece before moving to Phase 2 (MCP integration), which will unlock LLM gameplay and significantly expand the project's capabilities.

**Status**: Ready for detailed feature specification (FEATURES.md) and implementation planning.
