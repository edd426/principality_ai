# Principality AI - Project Status

*Last Updated: 2025-09-21*

## Project Overview

**Principality AI** is a solo-first Dominion-inspired deck-building card game designed for AI integration through Model Context Protocol (MCP). The project follows a phased development approach from MVP solo sandbox to full multiplayer with web UI.

## Current Phase: Phase 1 - Core Game Engine ✅ COMPLETE

### 🎯 Phase 1 Goals (ACHIEVED)
- [x] CLI-based solo sandbox game 
- [x] Core 8 kingdom cards implemented
- [x] Complete game loop (Action → Buy → Cleanup)
- [x] Seeded randomness for reproducible games
- [x] Immutable state pattern with TypeScript

## ✅ Completed Features

### Core Game Engine (`packages/core`)

**Game Mechanics Implemented:**
- **Immutable State Pattern**: All game state is readonly, changes create new state
- **Turn Structure**: Action Phase → Buy Phase → Cleanup Phase → Next Turn
- **Starting Conditions**: 7 Copper + 3 Estate cards, shuffled deck, hand of 5
- **Victory Conditions**: Game ends when Province pile empty OR any 3 piles empty

**Card System (All 8 MVP Cards):**
- **Basic Treasures**: Copper (+$1), Silver (+$2), Gold (+$3)
- **Victory Cards**: Estate (1 VP), Duchy (3 VP), Province (6 VP)
- **Kingdom Cards**: Village, Smithy, Laboratory, Market, Woodcutter, Festival, Council Room, Cellar

**Technical Features:**
- **Seeded Randomness**: Reproducible games with string seeds
- **Move Validation**: Comprehensive error handling for invalid actions
- **Game Over Detection**: Automatic winner calculation
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript with strict mode
- **Test Coverage**: 8 passing tests covering all core functionality

### Development Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETE
- **NPM Workspace**: Multi-package monorepo setup
- **TypeScript**: v5.0 with strict configuration
- **Jest Testing**: Unit test framework configured and working
- **ESLint**: Code quality tools configured and working
- **Build System**: TypeScript compilation to `dist/`
- **Quick Testing**: `npm run test-engine` for rapid validation

## 🧪 Test Results (All Passing)

```
PASS tests/game.test.ts
✓ should initialize game with correct starting state
✓ should play action cards correctly  
✓ should handle treasure playing in buy phase
✓ should handle card purchases
✓ should handle phase transitions
✓ should detect game over when Province pile is empty
✓ should validate invalid moves
✓ should get valid moves for each phase

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests: 8 passed, 8 total
```

## 🎮 Game Rules Implemented

### Starting Setup
- Each player starts with 7 Copper cards and 3 Estate cards
- Deck is shuffled using seeded randomness
- Players draw 5 cards for starting hand

### Turn Structure
1. **Action Phase**: Play action cards (default: 1 action available)
2. **Buy Phase**: Play treasures, purchase cards (default: 1 buy available)  
3. **Cleanup Phase**: Discard everything, draw 5 new cards, reset counters

### Card Effects System
- **+Cards**: Draw additional cards from deck
- **+Actions**: Gain additional actions this turn
- **+Buys**: Gain additional purchases this turn
- **+Coins**: Add money for purchasing
- **Special Effects**: Cellar's discard/draw mechanic

### Victory Scoring
- Estate: 1 Victory Point
- Duchy: 3 Victory Points  
- Province: 6 Victory Points
- Game ends when Province pile empty or 3+ piles empty

## 🔄 Game State Management

### Immutable Architecture
```typescript
interface GameState {
  readonly players: ReadonlyArray<PlayerState>
  readonly supply: ReadonlyMap<CardName, number>
  readonly currentPlayer: number
  readonly phase: 'action' | 'buy' | 'cleanup'
  readonly turnNumber: number
  readonly seed: string
  readonly gameLog: ReadonlyArray<string>
}
```

### Move System
```typescript
interface Move {
  type: 'play_action' | 'play_treasure' | 'buy' | 'end_phase' | 'discard_for_cellar'
  card?: CardName
  cards?: ReadonlyArray<CardName>
}
```

## 📈 Next Steps (Phase 2 Preparation)

### Immediate Priorities
1. **CLI Interface**: Create `packages/cli` for interactive testing
2. **Card Definitions**: Move to YAML format in `data/cards.yaml`
3. **Extended Testing**: Add edge case tests and integration tests

### Phase 2 Preparation (MCP Integration)
1. **Azure Functions Setup**: MCP server endpoints
2. **Natural Language Parser**: Convert text commands to moves
3. **Session Management**: In-memory game state storage
4. **MCP Tools**: `get_game_state()` and `make_move()` functions

## 🛠 Development Commands
