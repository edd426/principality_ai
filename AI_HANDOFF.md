# AI Agent Handoff Documentation

This document provides context for the next AI agent picking up development of the Principality AI project.

## 🎯 Current Project State (September 2025)

**Phase 1 Status: CORE ENGINE COMPLETE ✅**
- Game engine fully implemented and tested
- All development infrastructure working
- Ready to move to CLI implementation

### What's Working
- ✅ Core game engine (`packages/core/`) - 100% functional
- ✅ All 8 unit tests passing
- ✅ TypeScript compilation
- ✅ ESLint configuration and code quality
- ✅ Build system (`npm run build`)
- ✅ Testing infrastructure (`npm run test`)
- ✅ Manual engine validation (`npm run test-engine`)

### What's Missing
- ❌ CLI interface (`packages/cli/` is empty)
- ❌ MCP server (Phase 2)
- ❌ Web UI (Phase 4)

## 🔧 Development Environment

**Commands that work reliably:**
```bash
npm run test       # Run all unit tests
npm run build      # Build all packages
npm run lint       # Check code style
npm run test-engine # Quick engine validation
npm run play       # Shows helpful message about CLI not implemented
```

**Key files to understand:**
- `CLAUDE.md` - Complete development guidance (READ THIS FIRST)
- `packages/core/src/game.ts` - Main game engine
- `packages/core/src/types.ts` - Type definitions
- `packages/core/tests/game.test.ts` - Test examples showing API usage

## 🎮 Game Engine API Quick Reference

**Critical patterns for working with the engine:**
```typescript
// ALWAYS provide seed to constructor
const engine = new GameEngine('seed-string');
const gameState = engine.initializeGame(1);

// executeMove returns {success, gameState} - NOT direct state
const result = engine.executeMove(gameState, {type: 'end_phase'});
if (result.success) {
  gameState = result.gameState;
}

// Get available moves
const validMoves = engine.getValidMoves(gameState);
```

## 🚨 Common Gotchas & Solutions

### 1. **Module Loading Issues**
- Run commands from project root `/Users/eddelord/Documents/Projects/principality_ai`
- Use `./packages/core/dist/game.js` path for require()
- Build first: `npm run build`

### 2. **API Method Names**
- Use `executeMove()` not `makeMove()`
- Use `getValidMoves()` for available actions
- Constructor requires seed: `new GameEngine('seed')`

### 3. **Testing Approach**
- Unit tests work perfectly: `npm run test`
- Manual testing via Node.js scripts (see CLAUDE.md)
- CLI doesn't exist yet - this is expected

### 4. **Game State Structure**
- Cards are strings: `'Copper'` not objects
- Players array: `gameState.players[0].hand`
- Supply is Map: `gameState.supply.get('Copper')`

## 📋 Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. **Implement CLI Package** (Phase 1 completion)
- Create `packages/cli/package.json`
- Build simple CLI interface for game interaction
- Make `npm run play` functional
- Focus on single-player gameplay

### 2. **CLI Features to Implement**
- Initialize new game with seed
- Display current game state (hand, phase, actions/buys/coins)
- Accept move commands (play card, buy card, end phase)
- Show available moves
- Track game progression to victory

### 3. **CLI Design Suggestions**
- Interactive prompts for moves
- Clear game state display
- Command-line arguments for seeds
- Save/load game state (optional)

## 🔍 Code Quality Standards

- All code passes ESLint
- Unit tests required for new features
- TypeScript strict mode
- Immutable state pattern (readonly arrays/objects)
- Error handling for invalid moves

## 📊 Architecture Notes

**Game Engine Design:**
- Immutable state pattern - never modify state directly
- All game logic in pure functions
- Seeded random for reproducible games
- Move validation built into engine

**Workspace Structure:**
- `packages/core` - Game engine (complete)
- `packages/cli` - CLI interface (empty - YOUR TASK)
- `packages/*` - Future packages for MCP, web UI

## 🎲 Game Rules Implemented

- Starting: 7 Copper + 3 Estate cards
- Phases: Action → Buy → Cleanup
- 8 Kingdom cards available (Village, Smithy, etc.)
- Victory cards: Estate (1VP), Duchy (3VP), Province (6VP)
- Game ends when Province pile empty or 3 piles empty

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

**For CLI development:**
1. Use existing unit tests as API examples
2. Test CLI with various game scenarios
3. Validate against core engine behavior
4. Test error handling and edge cases

**Core engine is SOLID** - focus on CLI interface, not game logic.

## 💡 Success Criteria for Next Agent

**CLI Implementation Complete When:**
- `npm run play` starts an interactive game
- Can play a full game from start to finish
- All game phases work (action/buy/cleanup)
- Clear feedback on invalid moves
- Game victory properly detected
- Code quality matches core engine standards

**Ready for Phase 2 (MCP) when CLI works fully.**
